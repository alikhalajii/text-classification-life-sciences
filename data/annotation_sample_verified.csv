EG72,"Maintain Device Allocation Device allocation is historical. Time slices in periods that have already been billed can no longer be changed. These time slices can only be displayed. However, you can divide one time slice into two slices and maintain them. Example Time slice: 01/01/1996 to 12/31/1999 Period already billed: 01/01/1996 to 12/31/1999 The time slice is divided into two time slices: 01/01/96 to 12/31/1996 and 01/01/1997 to 12/31/9999. The unlimited time slice is not in the period billed and therefore can be maintained. It is also possible to define an allocation without an allocated device in order to store the attributes of the device allocation. For example, measured pressure can be stored in a pressure regulator allocation although the pressure regulators do no exist in the system. The attributes measured pressure for the pressure regulator allocation or billing factor for transformer allocations are relevant to billing and mandatory for gas meters or meters that do not measure directly. Device allocations can be defined at the register or device level of the controlled device. Metering devices (meaning devices with registers) are allocated at the register level. Devices without registers are always allocated at the device level. The controlling device is always entirely allocated to the controlled device. It is possible that a controlling device (such as a ripple control receiver) has been replaced during the time slice of the device allocation. In this case, the device that is valid at the beginning of the time slice is displayed. You must also set the TM indicator (device not valid for the entire period). You can double-click on this indicator to display the valid devices with corresponding validity periods.

When you carry out the allocation, the system does the following:Through the search rule you defined, the correct template is assigned to the receiver objectThe template finds the correct business process(es) or cost centers/activity typesIt calculates the quantities demanded/requiredIt sets the time period of the allocation and checks, if necessary, the activation requirements The result is a list of receiver and sender objects of the activity quantities and relevant costs (quantity*price). The price is calculated based on the valuation variant, which is tied to the receiver cost object for the simultaneous costing using the costing variant. If the receiving cost object is not tied with a costing variant for the simultaneous costing, then the planned price for the period is used for the valuation. The use of template allocations is one method to assign overhead costs. This method is unique for several reasons:Costs are not just allocated, but the system also determines the quantities that the respective receiver objects consume or utilize; costs are calculated based on the quantities and prices, and therefore more accurately determinedWorking with templates: the sender, quantities and activation time do not already exist, but can be dynamically determined through the template at the time of the calculationThe template uses functions defined by the user or already provided in the system to determine the needed data; these functions pull information already in fields or carry out complex algorithms from the operative data in the SAP system; they are created and maintained in the environment maintenanceSender objects can be business processes or cost centers/activity types.

FM_SETS_FICTR3,"Display Funds Center Group Group Editing In a group you can create more segment groups next to the direct combination of certain master data or assign groups that already exist as segment groups. This enables you to subdivide a complex group through segment groups into individual segments that makes it easier to understand. Note that a master record is only allowed to appear for each group once, including the subgroups. For the assigning of master data, the group editing also supports the entering of intervals. In this context you should note the following: If you have the master data selection of a group above an interval (for example, master data interval: AA to ZZ), then the new master data created, for which this interval definition applies, is automatically assigned to the group. Non-Year-Dependent Groups Master data groups are year-independent. You can limit the selection of valid master data in a group by entering a key date. If you are working with year-dependent master data in your organization, the validity period of an FM master record must lie within the validity period of the group. Otherwise this master record in the group is not taken into account. In such a case you receive the information No valid master record instead of the description of the master record.

FARR_POB_CANCEL,"Cancel POBs - For Classic Contract Management Complete performance obligations after cancellation Revenue Accounting searches for canceled performance obligations. Usually these performance obligations have a finalization date and their statuses are set to In process. Then the system changes their statuses to Completed if the finalization date is earlier than the date when the search takes place. In the meantime, the cumulative amount and quantity for these performance obligations are adjusted according to the invoiced quantity and processed amount. Future cancellations If you specify a current or past finalization date, the cancellation is processed immediately. However, if you specify a future finalization date, you need to run program FARR_POB_CANCELLATION when the date comes. Therefore, we suggest that you run this program regularly if you have specified a future finalization date. Canceling time-based performance obligations For a time-based performance obligation, if the finalization date is in the past and the date is earlier than the start date, then the end date will be changed to the start date; if the date is later than the start date, then the finalization date will be set as the end date. if the finalization date is in the future and the finalization date is earlier than the end date, the end date will be set to the finalization date. At the same time, the deferral method of the time-based performance obligation will be set to method 1 Linear Distribution, Day-Specific, 365/366 Basis no matter what it was originally. Canceling linked performance obligations When a leading performance obligation is canceled, its linked performance obligation will also be canceled. Canceling a performance obligation in the pending review worklists Performance obligations with a Pending Reviewstatus go to the pending review worklists, either the worklist for regular monitoring, the worklist for contracts with errors, or the worklist for contracts with conflicts. When these performance obligations are canceled, the cancellation is not performed immediately. Even when they have been removed from the pending review worklists, the system does not automatically perform the cancellation. You need to run program FARR_POB_CANCELLATION manually. Changing the finalization date You can set or change the finalization date using method ORDER_DATA_TO_ARL of BAdI FARRIC_BADI_ORDER. Reversing a cancellation You can recover contracts that were canceled in the past. After you have reversed a cancellation in the operational system, Revenue Accounting removes the finalization date and changes the status of the performance obligations back to In process. The cumulative amount and quantity is also adjusted accordingly. After sales orders have been sent to Revenue Accounting and revenue accounting contracts have been created, you may need to cancel the contracts for certain reasons. As soon as the cancellation is performed in the sender components, a finalization date will be sent to Revenue Accounting as a sign to terminate the performance obligations. In the meantime, the operational document is locked with the Rejection status and is therefore canceled. In such a case, only processable fulfilled revenue accounting items and processable invoice revenue accounting items can be processed and sent to Revenue Accounting. Note The cancellation is performed at performance obligation level. Only after all performance obligations have been canceled can the revenue accounting contract be canceled. Example There is a sales order as follows: Contractual Price Invoiced Amount Recognized Amount Fulfillment (Percentage) Unbilled Receivable EUR 1,000 EUR 900 EUR 980 98% EUR 80 For some reasons, you decide to cancel this order, so you perform the cancellation in Sales and Distribution (SD) and SD sends a finalization date to Revenue Accounting. In Revenue Accounting, the contract is adjusted as follows: The contractual price is set to the invoiced amount. The invoiced amount is the total amount in billing, credit memo, and debit memo documents that are posted. The amounts in the documents with future posting dates are also included in the calculation. The fulfillment is set to 100%. The unbilled receivables amount is set to 0. Contractual Price Invoiced Amount Recognized Amount Fulfillment (Percentage) Unbilled Receivable Finalization Date EUR 900 EUR 900 EUR 900 100% EUR 0 The day you perform the cancellation.

F888,"Waive Acceptance Request You can use this function either to process a single FI document (individual short-term waiver) or several due dates for a subledger account (mass short-term waiver or mass remission). During mass processing, FI documents are not grouped together – this is sometimes the case with mass deferrals. The documents are then processed individually instead, by entering the invoice reference, and then saved in the database. If you want to process documents with different currencies at the same time during mass processing, the data saved to the database may be inconsistent. In this is the case, the program only executes the short-term waiver/remission in the local currency. A short-term waiver and remission functions as an acceptance request. If you enter a short-term waiver (a remission), the system copies the original document specified and creates the short-term waiver (the remission). This is saved in the system as a parked document. The short-term waiver (the remission) has the opposite +/- sign to the original item. The parked document must undergo an approval procedure like a “normal” acceptance request. The posting can take place after the short-term waiver (remission) has been approved. Note As of 4.01A, it is only possible to waive a partial amount of an acceptance request. Short-term waivers and remissions are cleared automatically when they are posted. The system clears the original document (outgoing payment/acceptance request or the posted down payment) with the short-term waiver or remission. If more short-term waivers refer to the original document, these are also considered and cleared. Of course, documents are only cleared automatically when the balance between the original document and the document(s) that refer to it is 0 in the company code currency. The short-term waiver of an open claim means that the entitlement due is not pursued further. The difference between a short-term waiver and a remission is the following: with a short-term waiver, the entitlement itself is not waived, whereas this is the case with a remission. The prerequisites for using short-term waivers and remissions are defined by law. unknown Funds Management-Specific Postings Waive Acceptance Request",0,0

In this way, you have a ledger group-specific view of the account. Clearing is also performed for specific ledger groups. This means that: Items that you have posted in a specific ledger group can only be processed further within the same ledger group. If you have posted provisions, for example, to specific ledger groups, you also clear those provisions in the same ledger groups.

MIS2,"Change Inventory Sampling Procedure This component reduces the time and cost of a physical inventory considerably by counting only the stock of individual materials and carrying out an extrapolation to arrive at an estimated count result for all units of stock managed in the system (stock management units). The more materials a company has, the more costly it is to carry out a physical inventory by counting all stocks. The principle of extrapolation during sample taking is also used in quality inspection in the system: only one particular sample is inspected. The result is then applied to the entire quantity. However, such conclusions (from several counts of all stock management units) are only allowed when certain criteria are fulfilled: The scope of the stock management units involved in the physical inventory must be large enough. The selection of stock management units to be counted must be “representative”. Mathematical/statistical processes are used to perform the inventory sampling: A sample to be counted is randomly selected from the stock management units subject to physical inventory. The size of the sample depends on the probable degree of confidence that is valid for the projection of individual count results on all the stock management units involved. On the basis of the posted count results, the system carries out an extrapolation for all the stock management units included in the physical inventory. The inventory sampling is considered successful, if there is only a small deviation between the extrapolated value and the book value and a high probability that the extrapolation result contains only a minor error. In the case of a successful inventory sampling, it is assumed that the estimated variances from the book inventory are so small that they can be safely ignored. As in the case of a “standard” physical inventory, only the stock of the elements actually counted is adjusted. The stock of the remaining stock management units remains unchanged. If an inventory sampling is not successful, a complete physical inventory must be carried out for the stock management units not counted. unknown Inventory Management Change Inventory Sampling Procedure",0,0

There are two different procedures here: Payment advice note to the house bank:Before the due date of the bill of exchange payable, a letter (or DME file in France) is generated to advise the bank Which bill of exchange is expected to be submitted and how the bank should go about processing the bill. The house bank then processes the bill according to the payment advice note and debits the account of the drawee. Not all bills of exchange are paid or settled in full. In such cases, the house bank notifies either the bank where the bill was presented, or the bank from which the bill was presented to the drawee’s bank for payment. Payment advice note to the house bank:The house bank informs the drawee which bills of exchange were presented for payment, either in the form of written confirmation or by data medium exchange, (DME).

CPAE,"Run Actual Template Allocation - Profitability Analysis Enter the receiver objects in the entry screen for template allocation to determine the overhead costs. When you carry out the allocation, the system does the following:Through the search rule you defined, the correct template is assigned to the receiver objectThe template finds the correct business process(es) or cost centers/activity typesIt calculates the quantities demanded/requiredIt sets the time period of the allocation and checks, if necessary, the activation requirements The result is a list of receiver and sender objects of the activity quantities and relevant costs (quantity*price). The price is calculated based on the valuation variant, which is tied to the receiver cost object for the simultaneous costing using the costing variant. If the receiving cost object is not tied with a costing variant for the simultaneous costing, then the planned price for the period is used for the valuation. The use of template allocations is one method to assign overhead costs. This method is unique for several reasons:Costs are not just allocated, but the system also determines the quantities that the respective receiver objects consume or utilize; costs are calculated based on the quantities and prices, and therefore more accurately determinedWorking with templates: the sender, quantities and activation time do not already exist, but can be dynamically determined through the template at the time of the calculationThe template uses functions defined by the user or already provided in the system to determine the needed data; these functions pull information already in fields or carry out complex algorithms from the operative data in the SAP system; they are created and maintained in the environment maintenanceSender objects can be business processes or cost centers/activity types.

AIBU,"Execute Settlement - For AuC During the under construction phase, assets can be managed in a normal asset master record or in an asset master record with line item management, depending on the scope of functions you need. As a result, the transfer from the asset under construction to completed fixed assets can be handled in one of two ways: Summary transfer from a normal asset master record to the receiver assets (transaction type 348/349) As an asset master record with line item management, which you settle by line item to the receivers Recommendation For extensive investment measures, we recommend using the Investment Management (IM) component. Using the IM component, you can manage a capital investment in parallel: for financial accounting purposes as an asset under construction, and for controlling purposes as an internal order or project.For more information, see the documentation for the Investment Management component. Assets under Construction Without Line Item Management The procedure corresponds to the procedure for the transfer between two assets within the same company code (see Posting an Intracompany Asset Transfer (Splitting an Asset)). Before carrying out a full transfer of an asset under construction, you have to reverse any down payments that were posted in the current fiscal year. Down payments are ignored for a partial transfer. For transfers to be displayed in the asset history sheet as acquisitions to fixed assets, you use special transaction types for the transfer of assets under construction. Example Transfer of Asset under Construction to Capitalized Asset Assets under Construction with Line Item Management In Asset Accounting, you can accumulate costs under purely technical aspects in an asset under construction. You do not need to consider the later creation of fixed assets at this point. During the construction phase, you can accumulate all acquisitions for an investment in a single asset. These acquisitions include External activity (acquisition from vendor) Internal activity (internal order) Stock material (withdrawal from warehouse) When using this ""collective management"" of assets under construction, it is possible to manage the individual acquisitions as open items over the course of several fiscal years. At completion, the line items must be cleared and then distributed to the various receivers. The system activates open item management when an asset under construction is created, if you set the corresponding indicator in the asset class. In addition, for open item settlement, you have to assign a settlement profile to the company codes involved (in Customizing for Asset Accounting under Transactions&nbsp;&nbsp; Capitalization of Assets under Construction&nbsp;&nbsp;Define/Assign Settlement Profiles). The main function of the settlement profile is to specify the allowed receivers (such as, assets or cost centers). Example For an example, see Graphic: Line Item Settlement Distribution Rules Line item settlement is carried out by using distribution rules. Distribution rules are asset-specific. Several distribution rules form a distribution rule group. You can assign these groups to one or more line items of an asset. Distribution rules consist of a distribution key and a receiver. The distribution key can be equivalence numbers or percentage rates. In this way, you can distribute any number of combinations of line items to any number of combinations of receivers. Example Distribution rule group with percentage distributionDistribution proportion Receiver (Asset) 10% 10531 -1000 20% 10531 -2000 40% 10533 -0000 30% 10533 -1000 Distribution rule group with equivalence numbers1 : 2 : 4 : 3 Distribution by ledger group You have to set up the distribution of line items as specific to ledger groups, since the system writes one line item for each ledger group. Note It is only possible to maintain distribution rules in the view without the depreciation areas, because it is only possible to enter the distribution rule also for each ledger group. If in transaction Settlement of Asset Under Construction (AIAB) you want to display additional depreciation areas in the line item list, choose the Show/Hide Depreciation Areas pushbutton. Receiver You must settle those parts of the asset under construction that require capitalization to capitalized assets. Those parts that do not require capitalization (expense) can be settled as adjustment postings to cost centers. You can specify a cost element in the account determination in Asset Accounting for this settlement to cost centers. However, you should be aware that you can only settle acquisitions from the current fiscal year to CO receivers. This restriction applies since acquisitions from previous fiscal years should not have an effect on expenses of later fiscal years. In addition, it is possible to settle to general ledger accounts. However, these G/L accounts cannot be defined with additional account assignment to a CO object. Therefore, you should first settle to clearing accounts, if necessary, and then transfer the values to the corresponding accounts in Financial Accounting. Investment Support Just as it does for completed assets, the system calculates depreciation and interest for the asset under construction. This calculation is based on the depreciation terms specified in the asset master record or in the asset class. It is also possible to manage investment support on the asset under construction. However, it is not possible to transfer investment support that was posted to the asset under construction in the year of capitalization. The investment support cannot be transferred to a completed asset, because you cannot tell if the investment support applies to acquisitions in the current fiscal year or earlier fiscal years. Therefore, you have to reverse the investment support manually before the settlement. After the settlement, you post it to the completed asset. Carrying Out Settlement You can set up the settlement rules at a given point in time, and then carry out the corresponding update of the line items at a later point in time, since a separate transaction exists for the actual settlement (transaction AIBU). This transaction triggers the settlement posting for the selected assets under construction, and creates the necessary posting documents. During this process, the system automatically separates the transfer of asset acquisitions from prior fiscal years from acquisitions that took place in the year of capitalization. When the prior-year acquisitions are transferred, (special) depreciation and investment support measures are also transferred proportionally. The system automatically generates carryforward postings for partial capitalization. The standard report List of Origins of Asset Charges (RAHERK01) enables you to trace the origin of the items in the capitalized asset back to the original asset under construction. An asset that you produce yourself has two stages in its life that are relevant for accounting from the point of view of your company: Under construction phase Useful life Generally, an asset has to be shown in different balance sheet items, depending on the phase that it is in. Therefore, it is necessary to manage the asset as a separate object or asset master record during the construction phase. The transition between these two phases is called ""capitalization of the asset under construction"" in the following.

KEG5,"Run Actual Indirect Activity Allocation - Profitability Analysis Performing Assessment and Indirect Activity Allocation Given that cycles are allocated in assessment and in indirect activity allocation, the same procedure is executed for both. You can allocate cycles online or in the background. Recommendation Assessment cycles that process large amounts of data should always be executed in the background in order to avoid bottlenecks. It is recommended that you do not execute more than one large cycle in the same job step. You can perform cycles sequentially or in parallel. If you want to prevent specific cycles from being performed in parallel (such as ones that are dependent on other ones), you must assign these particular cycles to the same cycle run group (see also Processing Cycle Run Groups). If your controlling area and your operating concern use different currencies, the system translates the values during the transfer. For actual costs, the system uses the mean exchange rate (exchange rate type M). The default setting translates the values using the rate valid on the last day of the period. By choosing Extras&nbsp;&nbsp;Value Date in assessment, you can also enter a date on which the currency translation should take place.In planning, the exchange rate type is taken from the definition of the plan version. The system always uses the rate valid for the first day of the period. Line items are written, being credited to the cost centers/processes and debited from the profitability segments. To display these line items, use the information system or choose Assessment&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview or Indirect Activity Allocation&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview. In costing-based CO-PA, the receiver data is transferred to value fields in CO-PA. Records are also are created in CO-PA with record type D. For the allocation of actual data, the posting date is the last day of the period. For the allocation of planning data, the posting date is the first day of the period. If you repeat a cycle during a period, data already posted is canceled automatically before the cycle is run a second time. Note Along with the cycle name and the initial data, the sender version is also part of the unique key of a plan cycle. This means that you can carry out the same cycle repeatedly with different sender versions. Hence nothing is canceled if you change the sender version in the cycle definition. If you want to manually cancel a cycle, choose Indirect Activity Allocation&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancel or Assessment&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancel. Note Cancellation is always carried out at the line item level. Once you have archived your data or have deleted the line items in either Profitability Analysis or Cost Center Accounting, you can no longer reverse the cycles. You can check the allocation results (such as the sender and receiver information) by creating detailed lists (sender and receiver lists as well as journal lists) in which to record the results. To specify which detail lists should be created, select the detail lists indicator and choose List selection. If you perform allocation in the background, the system generates the following spool files:A spool file is generated for the basic list, the segment list, and for the receiver and sender lists if appropriate.If applicable, a separate spool file is generated for the journal list.If applicable, a separate spool file is generated for the expert trace. Moreover, you can display a runtime analysis (expert trace) or any messages while allocation is being executed. See also Results of Periodic Repostings or Periodic Allocations. The message section of the lists also contains information about which summarization levels were read (see also Defining Summarization Levels). You can improve performance significantly by defining suitable summarization levels. You can find more detailed explanations by double-clicking the individual messages. You can make the following settings by choosing Edit&nbsp;&nbsp;Settings:Enter the display variant for detail listsSpecify the strategy for database selectionEnter the name under which the detail lists are to be stored with the allocation resultsRecord the run log and the runtime analysisDetermine system behavior when an error has occurred during the collective execution of cycles. One main difference with allocating planned overhead is that a cycle cannot be defined by the name and initial date alone. Instead, the sender version is also an essential part of the key for the cycle to run. This allows you to reuse the same cycle for different planned versions. All you need to do is change the sender version, without having to define a completely new cycle for each version. Performing Template Allocation For information on performing template allocation, see the section on Executing Template Allocations in the online documentation for Activity-Based Costing (CO-OM-ABC).

Consumption Changes Displays the consumption changes of the materials in the company code currency for time periods. The consumption value is the result of the consumption multiplied by the current price. Inventory Aging Changes Inventory Aging Changes Calculation The inventory aging changes are defined as a percentage relationship between average stock quantity and consumption quantity in the selected time period. Average Stock Over Time Period Calculation For this KPI, note that inventory aging includes only goods issued with movement types, which are marked as consumption. Reversal postings are not considered. Inventory Turnover Changes Inventory Turnover Changes Calculation The inventory turnover changes are defined as a relationship between consumption quantity and average stock quantity in the selected time period (quarters, months, days). An inventory turnover determines how often the average material was destocked and restocked in a specific time frame. A high inventory turnover indicates that materials are not in storage for a long time and that storage costs are low. With this KPI, warehouse managers receive important information about special materials or material groups. Range of Coverage Changes Range of Coverage Changes Calculation The range of coverage changes are defined as a relationship between current stock quantity and the relationship between consumption and number of days in the selected time period. Average Consumption As a result you get the range of coverage in days. The range of coverage provides information at stock level in relation to demand.

KEPC,"Assign Costing Keys to Characteristics - Profitability Analysis To calculate the cost of sales, you define rules in CO-PA Customizing and then use these rules to call up one or more specific material cost estimates in Product Cost Planning. To tailor contribution margin accounting to your needs, you can trace and display different requirements, such as the following examples: You wish to call up the standard cost estimate that has been released for material valuation and to calculate the costs of sales that have been reconciled with Financial Accounting (FI) for the goods issue key date.In additional rows of your contribution margin report, you wish to calculate the contribution margins for group production costs and then value sold products accordingly using group costing.As a make-to-order manufacturer, you wish to draw on the sales order costing results stored in the sales order to calculate the cost of sales.To display the most reliable early-warning information about the expected result, you wish to value your incoming sales orders using future or current costing.For planning purposes, you should use a search strategy to check several cost estimates individually and then incorporate them into valuation. Procedure for Valuation using Material Cost Estimates The valuation rules described above are stored in Customizing for CO-PA and are defined by the combination of the costing key and the assignment of the costing key to characteristics. How all this is related is depicted in the following graphic: When a sales order or a billing document is posted, the system first checks whether valuation using material cost estimates is active. The type of costing that is to be used to calculate the cost of sales is specified in a costing key. Costing keys can be assigned to different characteristic values. The cost components for cost of goods manufactured from Product Cost Planning are assigned to value fields in CO-PA. Costing Key You use the costing key to define the rules specifying which cost estimates from Product Cost Planning should be used to value the cost of sales in CO-PA. Flexible assignment means that you can assign the desired cost estimates based on the product or material type, or based on any other characteristic in your operating concern. In the costing key, you define the callup parameters required for cost determination. The following includes an example demonstrating the valuation logic: You use the costing variant and the costing version to tell the system to access for valuation the standard cost estimate in a particular version.As the validity date for the cost estimate, choose the planning period indicator Released standard cost estimate matching goods issue date to reconcile the cost of goods manufactured in CO-PA with those in FI.Since the delivering plant comes under the organization of a marketing company, you do not wish to read from this plant's cost estimate in order to calculate the costs of goods manufactured. Instead, you wish to read from the production plant. You specify the desired plant in the costing key.Alongside the main cost component split, you also copy the auxiliary cost component split. In this way, both the primary cost component split and the cost component split for cost of goods manufactured can be used for analyses in CO-PA. There are two basic ways to calculate the cost of sales in Profitability Analysis (CO-PA). While a retail company only needs to know the total value of goods as cost of sales, a much more detailed breakdown of the costs of goods manufactured is required in a manufacturing company. The costs are represented in the cost component split for the cost of goods manufactured, which divides material values into fixed and variable cost components for the cost of goods manufactured (such as material costs, internal services, external services), which can then be entered into different rows during multi-leveled contribution margin accounting. Valuation with cost estimates therefore values in CO-PA the quantities of products sold together with the costing results (such as the standard cost estimate) that were calculated in Product Cost Planning (CO-PC). See also the section Costing Sequence. For valuation using cost estimates, you can also define an access key to the Actual Costing/Material Ledger in order to use the actual cost estimate to value your sales quantities during periodic revaluation (see Setting Up Valuation Using Actual Cost Estimates from Material L). Note As an alternative to valuation using material cost estimates, it is possible in retail companies to calculate the value of goods using a condition from the material master or the goods issue document. For more detailed information, see the section Valuation Using Conditions or choose Master Data&nbsp;&nbsp;Valuation and then in Customizing for CO-PA. unknown Profitability Analysis Profitability Analysis Assign Costing Keys to Characteristics - Profitability Analysis",0,0

View details of a maintenance order such as priority, final due date, associated notifications, and so on. Create a maintenance order for a single maintenance notification. When you create an order for a notification, the notification becomes the header notification of the order. The order inherits details from the notification. The new maintenance order has a unique order number. You can create an order for a notification only if the notification has not already been assigned to an order. Select multiple maintenance notifications and create one or more maintenance orders. Create a single maintenance order for the notifications you have selected and assign one of the notifications as the header notification. This notification will be displayed in the overview.

You can assign the existing order to the notification. Unassign an order from a notification. You can only unassign an order from a notification that is not the header notification. You can change the header notification in the Change Maintenance Order app. Select one or more maintenance orders and mass-edit several attributes by means of a quick action. For example, you can edit the location data, responsibilities, or the cost receivers that are maintained in a settlement rule. You can run a simulation to test the data, or apply the mass change directly in the system. You can view the details of the simulated or scheduled job in the Application Logs. For more information, see Mass Editing of Maintenance Orders. Submit one or more orders for approval. Some orders require an approval based on order attributes and cost. In this case, the maintenance planner has to submit the order for approval before it can be released to the Preparation phase. Whether or not an approval is required depends on the approval settings that have been defined for a combination of maintenance order type and planning plant in Customizing under Define Approval Settings for Maintenance Orders. Note The approvers for an order can be determined by means of workflow rules. Depending on the configured workflows, the defined approvers will see the submitted orders in the My Inbox app, where they can approve or reject them. For more information, see Manage Workflows for Maintenance Orders and Manage Teams and Responsibilities. Change the responsibility for one or more maintenance notifications and maintenance orders. For each attribute, you can keep the existing values, select new values, or leave the field blank. You can't change the responsibility for orders that have been submitted for approval. Select one or more maintenance orders and change the order status. You can, for example, release the selected orders, complete them from a technical and business perspective, block further processing, or mark orders for deletion. You can also cancel certain order statuses. Select one or more maintenance notifications and change the notification status. You can complete the selected notifications, mark them for deletion, or remove the deletion flag. Navigate to related apps from the object page. Generate output items using the Determine Output Items quick action button on the notification object page. If output items aren't yet available for a maintenance request, pressing the quick action button populates the output items table. If output items have already been generated, pressing the button again redetermines the output items depending on the parameters or status of the request. Once the output is sent, it moves to the status To be Output and then to Completed when it is finally done. You can see the output preview from the icon in the Display column.

MICN,"Create PI Documents - Cycle Counting Cycle counting is a method of physical inventory whereby inventory is counted at regular intervals within a fiscal year. These intervals depend on the cycle counting indicator set for the material. Cycle Counting allows you to count fast-moving items more frequently than slow-moving items, for example. General Procedure Mark all materials that are to be included in cycle counting with a cycle counting indicator in the material master record (storage data). The cycle counting indicator is used to group the materials together into various cycle counting categories (for example, A , B , C, and D). In Customizing for Inventory Management, you can define for each category the time intervals at which the materials are to be counted. You can use the program ABC Cycle Counting Analysis ( RMCBIN00) to perform an analysis. In this analysis, the system assigns the materials to the individual categories according to consumption or requirements. You can also specify whether this analysis is to consider only the materials with cycle counting indicator or all materials. The cycle counting indicator in the material master records can be updated automatically by this program. For the planning of cycle counting, run the program Create physical inventory documents for cycle counting ( RM07ICN1 ). This program checks all cycle counting materials to determine whether a physical inventory is due to be carried out. Note For more information on programs used for cycle counting, see the relevant report documentation. You can create physical inventory documents for the following stock types, as well as unrestricted-use stock (stock type 1): quality inspection stock blocked stock The system calculates the planned count date for all stock types as folllows: Date of last physical inventory of unrestricted-use stock + predefined interval If a material needs to be counted, use the program to create a batch input session for creating physical inventory documents. To create the physical inventory documents, process the batch input session . When the inventory differences are posted, the actual count date is recorded in the physical inventory data of the material as the date of the last physical inventory. unknown Inventory Management Cycle Counting Create PI Documents - Cycle Counting",0,0

VF02,"Change Billing Documents Change billing document details such as the billing date, texts, pricing, and output items Note Depending on the timing, you can make only limited changes. Before the system has forwarded the billing document to financial accounting, you can do the following: Change the billing date (in the header details), texts, and output items. This includes the option to trigger a redetermination of output items, which adds the new output items underneath the existing ones. Carry out new pricing for individual items or change the prices manually After the system forwards the billing document to financial accounting, you can only change output items and texts. If you need to make other changes, you will have to cancel the billing document and create a new one. Search for billing documents by document number, company code, fiscal year, or reference Cancel the billing document that you are currently viewing When you cancel a billing document, the system creates a billing document cancellation (for example, an invoice cancellation), which copies data from the billing document and creates an offsetting entry in financial accounting when it is posted. The cancellation causes the preceding billable document (for example, the delivery) to be open for billing again, so that you can then create the correct billing document.Note If the system has already posted the now-canceled billing document to financial accounting, it has also automatically posted the corresponding cancellation billing document to offset the canceled document's entry. If the system has not yet posted the canceled billing document to financial accounting, both the canceled billing document and the cancellation billing document receive posting status E (billing document canceled). In this case, posting is not necessary and no journal entries are created. Display the document's output items and perform actions such as send, add, and duplicate output, and more. You can also display a PDF preview of the output, which shows what the billing document will look like when it's printed or converted to PDF format. Note The values of some tax fields may not be finalized until the billing document has been posted to financial accounting. Therefore, there are sometimes small numeric discrepancies between tax field values in the output preview (which is generated before posting) and the final output (which is generated after posting). This can be due to financial accounting applying a different currency exchange rate than was used at the time of billing document creation.In some cases, a value may not be calculated at all until the billing document has been posted, and will therefore be missing in the preview.In case of doubt, the values in the final output are correct and the values in the preview should be disregarded. Navigate to an overview of associated accounting documents Navigate to the document flow and the pricing conditions for the headerTip The document flow in the Display Billing Documents and Change Billing Documents apps exposes the entire related document chain, independent of business role.In contrast, the process flow in the Manage Billing Documents app and the Billing Document object page offers a simplified representation of the document chain that focuses on documents that are central to the responsibilities of the billing clerk.

The following layouts are described in more detail: Itemization by Costing Item Itemization by Cost Component / Cost Element Itemization by Operation Itemization by Cost Element Note You can create your own layouts to be able to see other information in the itemization. For example, you can add the purchasing info record and the purchasing organization or the origin groups to the report display, or add the text of the activity types or item categories.

With material costs, the origin group is entered in the material master record. With overhead costs, the origin group is entered in the credit key of the costing sheet. Cost Elements In the itemization, you can also see the costs broken down into cost elements. Material costs, external activities, and non-stock materials are assigned to primary cost elements. In this itemization they are shown under cost elements determined by the system. Costs for internal activities are displayed under the allocation cost element of the activity type that was entered in the master record of the activity type.

The G/L accounts are also updated. For each asset a transfer document is created that posts the transfer values, for example, on the APC and accumulated depreciation account and against the offsetting account for the legacy data transfer. With a data transfer during the year, you transfer asset-related business transactions that occurred before the transfer date in the current fiscal year (transfer using transaction AB01L).If a posting date in the current fiscal year is entered that is before the transfer date, the system recognizes this business transaction as a transfer document; no depreciation is calculated, the document is posted against the offsetting account for the legacy data transfer.

However, take into account the following special features of legacy assets: The capitalization date is always a required entry. Using the capitalization date, the system determines the depreciation start date and the expired useful life, based on the period control in the depreciation key.If the asset was acquired at a time when the company code had a different fiscal year variant, this determination of the useful life will be correct only if the period calendar assignments have been maintained historically. The planned useful life is a required entry when a depreciation key for automatic depreciation calculation has been entered.You can also account for increased wear and tear on an asset in the past as the result of multiple shift use. You do this by manually correcting the expired useful life that was automatically calculated by the system. Time-dependent data (such as the assignment to a cost center) can only be transferred with the values current on the transfer date. To create new time intervals, you have to use the function for changing master data. Post Asset Values (Transfer Values). Take into account the following special features when transferring legacy asset values: Depreciation areas:You must take all active depreciation areas for the asset into account, and enter the historical acquisition costs. Posted depreciation (for a transfer during the year)If you transfer legacy data during the fiscal year, you can enter the depreciation that was already posted in the legacy system in the current fiscal year.Specify the last depreciation period posted (in the legacy system) (field FAA_DEPR_PERIOD) when entering the depreciation posted in the transfer year. The system requires this information to determine the first period for the depreciation that should be posted in the SAP system.Manual depreciation first generates a statistical noted item in Asset Accounting and, depending on the posting indicator for the depreciation area, is posted to the FI accounts with the following depreciation run. Make sure then that, for a transfer during the year of depreciation posted manually (for example, with transaction type 640), the respective amount (depending on the posting indicator and on whether postings to FI accounts took place in the legacy system or not) has to be a partial amount of the posted depreciation transferred during the year (transaction type 500). Transactions (for a transfer during the fiscal year)With a legacy data transfer during the fiscal year, the transfer date of the given company code is not the end of the fiscal year (see Transfer During the Year). You can transfer the transactions from the current fiscal year up to the date of the transfer for legacy data transfer during the fiscal year.Make the following entries when transferring transactions:Asset value dateNote that the asset value date has to be in the current fiscal year, and it must lie before the transfer date. Transaction type Posting Amount Posted revaluations:Posted revaluations are first entered in Asset Accounting as statistical items and are only then transferred (posted) to the FI accounts with the next depreciation run. Depending on the Customizing settings for the depreciation area, it is therefore necessary to specify the revaluations within the framework of the depreciation posted during the year as both a statistical line item as well as a “posted value”. The values you enter are also checked against the positive/negative sign rules of the depreciation area (positive/negative net book value, positive/negative ordinary depreciation, and so on). Change Transfer Values Subsequently If wrong transfer values were posted, you must reverse the journal entry and then enter the transfer values again. You can only change transfer values by reversing the posted transfer document and making a new posting. To be able to reverse a transfer document, subsequent transactions are not allowed to exist on the fixed asset. If follow-on transactions were already posted on the fixed asset, we recommend you proceed as follows: Reverse all transactions in reverse chronological order. Reverse the transfer transaction. Post the new transfer values. Enter the follow-on transactions again individually. Depreciation Areas in Foreign Currencies With the manual data transfer, you must transfer the historical values from the feeder system. The foreign currency amounts cannot be determined using an exchange rate by a specified key date. The system therefore does not support historical currency translations; in fact you must enter the values. Note The settings defined in Customizing activity Asset Accounting&nbsp;&nbsp;Asset Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Parameters for Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer Foreign Currency Areas (transaction OAYD) only affect automatic transfers; they have no effect on manual data transfers (transaction ABLDT).

FP40,"Transfer Items During the transfer, the system clears the selected items and posts them to the target account. As much of the posting information as possible is transferred. The new items only differ from the original items in their origin and posting date. The receivables account, due date, transaction name, and dunning and interest information remain the same for these items. You maintain transactions for the transferred items in Customizing for Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable under Business Transactions&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers&nbsp;&nbsp;Define Transactions for Transferring Items. During the transfer, the system does not perform account determination again for the new items. However, this makes it easier to read the account balance display, since you can recognize the transferred items directly from the transaction and transaction text. In event 5110, you can define whether existing payment and dunning locks are retained. If the target account for the transfer posting is a contract account that belongs to a collective bill account, the collective bill is updated automatically. The following can be transferred: Individual items – receivables and credits (see also the explanations for transfer postings in Clarifying Credits) All items of a business partner All items of a contract account All items of a contract Items in an installment plan; The existing installment plan is automatically deactivated and a new installment plan is created in the amount of the still open original receivable. Items belonging to a collective bill; The collective bill is updated automatically. You can reverse the transfer document. For more information about transferring, see SAP Note 616098 . Transferring receivables or credits is necessary if a business partner assumes the rights and obligations of another business partner, such as in the case of inheritance or taking on liabilities. From time to time it might also be necessary to transfer receivables or credits within different contracts or contract accounts of the same business partner.

FM_CISUB_SET2,"Change Cmmt Item Substrings Group You can create, maintain, copy, and automatically generate substring groups. Substring Groups A substring group can include existing substring groups of this substring. This way you can divide a complex group of master data objects into segments that are self-explanatory and therefore easier to understand. To define substring groups, you can specify intervals for the values of the substrings. Provided that you have defined the selection of substring groups using an interval (for example, master data interval AA to ZZ), the new master data, for which this selection applies, is automatically assigned to the respective master data substring group. Note The substring groups for master data are year-independent. This means that if you create new master data in the following year, this master data will automatically belong to the substring group that it belonged to in the previous year. Automatic Generation of Substring Groups You can generate the substring groups automatically for each substring with a master data subdivision using transaction FMMD_SETGEN.Prerequisite for this is that you have defined a structure within a substring in Customizing. These groups can then be used in the reports of the Report Painter. For more information, see the system documentation for this transaction. You can create substring groups for a substring. This means that you can create your substrings in groups for the subdivision of master data. You use the following transactions for this: FM_CISUB_SET1, FM_CISUB_SET2, FM_CISUB_SET3 (substring groups for commitment item) FM_FCSUB_SET1, FM_FCSUB_SET2, FM_FCSUB_SET3 (substring groups for funds center) FM_FCSUB_SET1, FM_FCSUB_SET2, FM_FCSUB_SET3 (substring groups for fund) FM_FNSUB_SET1, FM_FNSUB_SET2, FM_FNSUB_SET3 (substring groups for functional area) You can use the substring groups for the selection of Report Writer reportsin Funds Management, provided that the reports are based on the data of the special ledger. You can also use substring groups in the component Controlling (CO) to execute evaluations of Report Writer reports and to select substring groups in CO transactions To do this, you subdivide the substrings of the account assignment elements (commitment item, funds center, fund, functional area) into groups according to specific subdivision criteria.

The payment is not forwarded to the Collections/Disbursements system. Another claim handler with sufficient release authorization must check the payment and release or reject it. As payouts directly influence the economic results of a company, management often rules that the dual control principle must be applied. If a payment is selected for the dual control principle, this payment must be checked by another processing clerk. If this processing clerk regards the payment as correct, he or she releases this payment. Only then is the payment forwarded to the Collections/Disbursements system.

FP_KMIG,"Set Subsequent Account Assignments You can enter the following account assignments in business partner items in the posting document in Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable: Business area Segment Profit center If you have not used one these account assignments up to now, but want to use it in the future, you can only do so in new documents. You cannot change any of these account assignments subsequently in documents that were already posted, since this would cause errors in the reconciliation with the general ledger. As a result, the account assignments are also missing in follow-on postings that arise due to clearing or other follow-on processes (such as cash discounts, payment surcharges, interest, exchange rate differences, or down payments on statistical request) for these documents. For key date evaluations of open items, balances without account assignment remain until the last items without account assignment are cleared. To keep this from happening, you can use a prepared enhancement to add a second set of account assignment fields in your business partner items. The added account assignment fields then receive the additional designation Assigned Subsequently to Account (for example Profit Center (Assigned Subsequently to Account)). If the original account assignments are not set, after implementing the enhancement, fill the additional fields with the appropriate account assignments using a mass activity (on the SAP Easy Access screen under Changeovers in Live System&nbsp;&nbsp;Set Subsequent Account Assignments in Business Partner Items; transaction FP_KMIG). The system derives the appropriate account assignment using event 0949. You have to define this event to meet your requirements. You can use these subsequently set account assignments as follows: Follow-on postings for items with subsequent account assignment receive the account assignments in exactly the same way as if the original fields in the business partner item had had these account assignments. The system takes follow-on postings into account for:Clearing (cash discounts, payment surcharges, exchange rate differences, down payments on request, charges on request) Write-off (expense or revenue) Interest Calculation The goal is for all postings to have account assignment to the income statement, and not to allow any new, open business partner items to be created without account assignment. Therefore, the system always takes into account all subsequently set account assignments, without taking a key-date-dependent view, as with reports on open items. The clearing posting on the receivables account or payables account is not affected by the subsequent account assignments, since the clearing of an item always has to be posted with the same account assignments as were used when the item was created. Valuation gains and valuation losses resulting from foreign currency valuation also receive their account assignments as if the account assignments were already entered in the original fields in the business partner items. You can also take the subsequent account assignments into account for key date evaluations of open items (reclassification, aging, foreign currency valuation). For each company code, enter the key date, starting from which this should take place, in Customizing for Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable under Closing Operations&nbsp;&nbsp;Define Settings for Subsequent Account Assignments. The system then displays the balances and all required adjustment postings for receivables and payables as if the original account assignment fields were set. Since the general ledger still records the balances without account assignment, the system proposes additional adjustment postings, that you can post from the SAP Easy Access screen under Periodic Processing&nbsp;&nbsp;Closing Preparation&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjustments for Subsequent Account Assignment (transaction FPACCADJ). Using these adjustments, the system reduces the balances without account assignment using the adjustment accounts for receivables and payables, and builds up balances with account assignment. As a result of this adjustment, the receivables and payables for postings from subsequent account assignments appear in the balance sheet as if they were originally entered with these account assignments. Note The entries in the Customizing activity Define Settings for Subsequent Account Assignments then also cause the enrichment of account assignments for key date evaluations, if no subsequent account assignments were set, but an enrichment was made at event 0945 during the general ledger transfer. All adjustment postings for receivables and payables then inherit the account assignments that the system added during the general ledger transfer.

CK80_99,"Cost Components - Materials Main Cost Component Splits and Auxiliary Cost Component Splits You can display the costs as a cost component split for the cost of goods manufactured and/or primary cost component split. You can calculate the cost component split for the cost of goods manufactured and primary cost component split simultaneously. You can switch between the two cost component views (under Settings&nbsp;&nbsp;Type of cost component split). However, you can also generate only the cost component split for the cost of goods manufactured or the primary cost component split. If you want to cost both cost component splits simultaneously, you must determine which cost component split is the main cost component split in Customizing for Product Cost Controlling. You can also generate a further cost component split as an auxiliary cost component split for comparison purposes. Note The update of the standard price in the material master is effected by the main cost component split.An itemization is only created for the main cost component split. In the report, you can switch between the main cost component split and the auxiliary cost component split. With the appropriate setting, you can switch between the cost component split for the cost of goods manufactured and the primary cost component split. Upper Level/Lower Level/Aggregate Level The cost estimate enables you to analyze the value added within a multilevel production structure. You can apportion the costs for each material according to the lower level and upper level. You can find the cost component split display under Costs&nbsp;&nbsp;Display Cost components. You can make this setting with Settings&nbsp;&nbsp;Layout. You can create your own report from a large number of selections options. When you display the costs: For the upper level, you see the production costs, overhead costs and costs for external activities that are expected for this production level. For the lower level, you see the costs of all material components that are processed in this production level. In both cases, the costs are broken down according to cost components. The total cost of the upper level and lower level equals the total costs of the production level being analyzed. You can go to the following other reports in the same report group: Total values Upper level Lower level When the costs are apportioned according to cost components, the original identity of the costs (for example, costs of materials or fixed and variable production costs) are maintained throughout all production levels. At every production level, the value added at that level and the costs of the lower level can be separated through the cost component split. When you save a material cost estimate or a costing run, the system automatically updates a cost component split for each costed material. If you want to create a cost component split for raw materials and purchased parts, you can enter additive cost components for each material for these costs. You can then group these cost components in an ""External procurement"" cost component structure that only contains such costs. This report shows the costs calculated in a material cost estimate or sales order cost estimate across all production levels, broken down into cost components. You can analyze the costs of the cost component split for the cost of goods manufactured and the costs of the primary cost component split. The results of a cost estimate are updated as cost components (this is called a cost component split). The cost components break down the costs of a material across the entire production structure into material costs, production costs, material overhead, production overhead, and other costs. The costs for internal activities normally flow into the cost component split under secondary cost elements. In order to present primary costs for internal activities, you can use a primary cost component split as an alternative way of outlining the cost components. The cost component split enables you to do the following: Analyze the cost origin across multiple production levels.You can analyze the value added within a multilevel production structure. The costs of the upper level consist of the internal activities and the overhead costs that are incurred at that level. The costs of the lower level include the materials and raw materials. The total costs of the upper level and lower level equal the total costs of the production level being analyzed. View the costs by original production factors (primary cost component split). Structure the costs according to the requirements of other areas (such as material valuation or profitability analysis).In the cost component view, you can specify which cost elements are displayed in the report. For example, you can select the cost of goods manufactured or the cost of goods sold, or the costs that are relevant to inventory valuation. You specify various cost component views in Customizing for Product Cost Planning. For each cost component, you can decide which share of the costs contained therein (fixed, variable, full) is displayed in which cost component view.

You can use the reconciliation keys you create for any postings as long as the keys remain open. You can aggregate reconciliation keys under one reconciliation key (aggregation key) before the transfer to the general ledger. In that case, the system adds the totals records that have the same account assignment together, which reduces the number of totals records. As a result, you transfer only the totals records of the aggregation key. This enables you to reduce the number of posting items in the general ledger. When you create a reconciliation key you can flag the reconciliation key for aggregation. If you set the indicator, the reconciliation key can only be transferred to the general ledger after it has been aggregated.

For more information, see Storage Bin Determination for Putaway or Stock Determination. Extract Time Determination The extract time determination calculates the target time effort to execute a stock movement. EWM determines this time for each warehouse task. Warehouse order creation adds up the extract time of the individual warehouse tasks for a warehouse order. Optionally, warehouse order creation supplements the extract time determination with a setup time that is defined in the warehouse order creation rule. In addition, if resource management is used, a route time is determined based on the resource used. The warehouse order includes the sum of these times. Based on this, EWM determines the latest start time of a warehouse order. The parameters of extract time determination formulas for a warehouse task are dependent on the product, the quantity, the unit to be transported, and geographical dependencies. For more information about Customizing for extract time determination, see Customizing for Extended Warehouse Management under Cross-Process Settings&nbsp;&nbsp;Warehouse Task&nbsp;&nbsp;Define Extract Time Determination. Determination of Packing Instructions / Packaging Specifications for Customer-Defined Packing and Picking When creating warehouse tasks for relevant outbound delivery order items, the system determines suitable packing instructions or packaging specifications using unified package building (see Unified Package Building). Outbound delivery order items are relevant if the predecessor sales document item is relevant to pick HUs by packing instruction or packaging specification. The system takes the packing instruction or packaging specification into account during the filtering and sorting of stock (see Storage Bin Determination for Stock Removal). As a prerequisite, the document type of the outbound delivery process for the outbound delivery order must contain a unified package building profile for picking HUs by packing instruction or packaging specification. For more information, see Customizing for Extended Warehouse Management under Goods Issue Process&nbsp;&nbsp;Outbound Delivery&nbsp;&nbsp;Define Document Types for Outbound Delivery Process. For more information about customer-defined packing and picking, see Customer-Defined Packing and Picking. Extended Warehouse Management (EWM) uses this function so that when you or EWM release a wave, EWM simultaneously creates warehouse tasks for stock removal or internal stock movements. EWM creates warehouse orders pursuant to the warehouse tasks, to assemble work packages for the individual warehouse workers. Instead of this standard creation of warehouse tasks through wave release, you can also create a warehouse task as follows: Manually, with the user interface Automatically, by calling a Post Processing Framework action (PPF action) Warehouse Clerk (Extended Warehouse Management) : Plans and controls processes in a simple warehouse with a strong focus on inbound, outbound, physical inventory, and maintenance of warehouse specific master data.

MIS1,"Create Inventory Sampling Procedure - ERP System This component reduces the time and cost of a physical inventory considerably by counting only the stock of individual materials and carrying out an extrapolation to arrive at an estimated count result for all units of stock managed in the system (stock management units). The more materials a company has, the more costly it is to carry out a physical inventory by counting all stocks. The principle of extrapolation during sample taking is also used in quality inspection in the system: only one particular sample is inspected. The result is then applied to the entire quantity. However, such conclusions (from several counts of all stock management units) are only allowed when certain criteria are fulfilled: The scope of the stock management units involved in the physical inventory must be large enough. The selection of stock management units to be counted must be “representative”. Mathematical/statistical processes are used to perform the inventory sampling: A sample to be counted is randomly selected from the stock management units subject to physical inventory. The size of the sample depends on the probable degree of confidence that is valid for the projection of individual count results on all the stock management units involved. On the basis of the posted count results, the system carries out an extrapolation for all the stock management units included in the physical inventory. The inventory sampling is considered successful, if there is only a small deviation between the extrapolated value and the book value and a high probability that the extrapolation result contains only a minor error. In the case of a successful inventory sampling, it is assumed that the estimated variances from the book inventory are so small that they can be safely ignored. As in the case of a “standard” physical inventory, only the stock of the elements actually counted is adjusted. The stock of the remaining stock management units remains unchanged. If an inventory sampling is not successful, a complete physical inventory must be carried out for the stock management units not counted. unknown Inventory Management ERP System Create Inventory Sampling Procedure - ERP System",0,0
