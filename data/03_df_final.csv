"Plan Repairs Call up a worklist of all repair objects to individually plan their diagnosis or repair (statuses Plan: Diagnosis or Plan: Repair). You can filter, sort, and group a list of repair objects to be planned. You can also filter for repair objects to be planned by a specific employee responsible or by the credit status that has been determined in the repair order. Display the details of the repair objects that are currently in planning. You can access the related product and equipment data to check its details.​ Create a returns order to trigger the logistics process for repair objects that customers send for repair. In this case, you can create an outbound delivery to send the repair object back to the customer. Access the repair order to enter the planning details. Use the worklist to trigger actions (for example, create returns order) for multiple repair objects in the same in-house repair simultaneously or for each repair object individually. You can use this app to schedule the diagnosis and the repair of the objects, and assign the service employee.

"Production Material Requests You use the production material request for planning and monitoring the supply of products to production, and for the consumption of products by production, using advanced production integration. The system creates a production material request when SAP ERP sends a message containing the required information from production. SAP ERP sends this message when the manufacturing order is released, and WM material staging is triggered, either automatically or in the Production Order Change transaction, either by choosing Function&nbsp;&nbsp;WM Material Staging&nbsp;&nbsp;Execute, or by clicking the WM Material Staging button. If the manufacturing order is changed in SAP ERP, the system updates the production material request in EWM for changes that are relevant for EWM, such as a changed quantity for staging.

"Maintain Device Allocation Device allocation is historical. Time slices in periods that have already been billed can no longer be changed. These time slices can only be displayed. However, you can divide one time slice into two slices and maintain them. Example Time slice: 01/01/1996 to 12/31/1999 Period already billed: 01/01/1996 to 12/31/1999 The time slice is divided into two time slices: 01/01/96 to 12/31/1996 and 01/01/1997 to 12/31/9999. The unlimited time slice is not in the period billed and therefore can be maintained. It is also possible to define an allocation without an allocated device in order to store the attributes of the device allocation. For example, measured pressure can be stored in a pressure regulator allocation although the pressure regulators do no exist in the system. The attributes measured pressure for the pressure regulator allocation or billing factor for transformer allocations are relevant to billing and mandatory for gas meters or meters that do not measure directly. Device allocations can be defined at the register or device level of the controlled device. Metering devices (meaning devices with registers) are allocated at the register level. Devices without registers are always allocated at the device level. The controlling device is always entirely allocated to the controlled device. It is possible that a controlling device (such as a ripple control receiver) has been replaced during the time slice of the device allocation. In this case, the device that is valid at the beginning of the time slice is displayed. You must also set the TM indicator (device not valid for the entire period). You can double-click on this indicator to display the valid devices with corresponding validity periods. You can also display these devices by selecting the appropriate line and choosing Extras&nbsp;&nbsp;History It is also possible to define your own allocation types. To do this, you add new entries to the table of allocation types. These allocations are not relevant to billing, however. This function enables you to allocate devices to one another and store additional attributes. A distinction is made between controlled devices, such as meters, and controlling devices, such as a transformer switched in series.

"Maintain Groups - Characteristic Values You can group characteristic values from one characteristic as required, and arrange characteristic value groups and individual characteristic values in a hierarchy. You can assign a characteristic value to several characteristic value groups.You define the hierarchy in the navigation area. A characteristic value group corresponds to a node. In the work area, you can assign the characteristic values you require to individual nodes. Note When you are processing an article, the system only displays the characteristic values that you have assigned to a characteristic value group in the search help for characteristic value selection. You can only enter other characteristic values manually. You can assign merchandise categories to a characteristic value group to specify that the characteristic values in this characteristic value group are only used in the assigned merchandise categories. If you do not assign anything to it, the characteristic value group is valid for all merchandise categories.To assign characteristic values to a node in the hierarchy, or to restrict the use of characteristic values to certain merchandise categories, you use the functions in the Characteristic Value Assignment and Merchandise Category Restriction work areas.You can, for example, use multiple selection to assign several characteristic values in one process step, or to assign several merchandise categories by selecting one characteristics profile. You can display change documents for the grouping data. Grouping characteristic values simplifies the search for characteristic values when you are creating articles. You use existing characteristic values to create a hierarchy grouping, which enables you to divide the characteristic value total into manageable partial quantities. You can assign a characteristic value to several groups. unknown Merchandise Categories Master Data Specialist - Product Data (Retail) Characteristic Values Maintain Groups - Characteristic Values",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,Other,Other,Other,Other,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,Other,Other,0.009747449114409263,0.058820694537821,0.032882891892037504,-0.06002968898142253,0.0020211207058379397,-0.02406121332673651,-0.029202090832577028,0.03406381384363303,-0.025839821175741972,-0.01580704128576083,0.02951619604074486,-0.036174516765905176,-0.013783686357608663,-0.03390381815685515,-0.02315538950675309,0.013905842077250864,-0.02021717696105194,0.003437985461420912,0.0014960341021562908,-0.01699928468476815,-0.0015321772327503858,0.014860364837603664,0.039699674413353994,0.013387421784820669,-0.006901569186232083,-0.00993975878657052,-0.00956558625532389,-0.010200509561710352,-0.034834481198961084,0.014676449480613538,-0.0348397286978509,0.017625455077967603,-0.00742210790863146,-0.013657105417988898,-0.04124885907960584,0.002779252655160544,-0.06682862883015453,-0.0018331325328721393,0.007429171221567901,-0.03675231425390281,0.015668217103941486,0.07751707084357316,-0.03342576835817102,0.02309845407663358,-0.0026146043613293783,0.028930248718595473,-0.05610905596300293,-0.014004651844141916,0.03520047311096871,-0.021486169866178084

"Run Settlement - Projects - Actual Business objects are settled by allocating the planned or actual costs incurred, in whole or in part, to one or more receivers. Offsetting entries are generated automatically to credit the sender object. The debits that were made to the sender object remain in place after settlement (and can therefore be displayed). The settled costs are updated on the corresponding receiver object and are shown in reports. Note Settlement is performed in parallel in all valuation methods except settlement to fixed assets or profitability segments. Settlement to fixed assets uses the legal valuation amount. Settlement to profitability segments uses the operational valuation amount. The order is debited in all valuations as shown in the figure below. Line items can only be settled to an asset if the legal valuation method is your operational valuation. Cost Accountant - Overhead : Defines overhead master data and the period-end allocation cycle. Implements period-end allocation and monitors overhead costs. Reports expenses on the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.

"Clean Up Productive Data, Clean Up Productive Data, Clean Up Productive Data, Clean Up Productive Data The program can only be run for cleaning up RAIs and relevant revenue contracts related to header IDs coming from external sender components and Sales and Distribution (SD). It cannot be used for CRM and Billing and Revenue Innovation Management (BRIM) - previously SAP Hybris Billing. This program only applies to company codes that are set to Productive for all accounting principles. This program handles the selected data as follows: If the revenue contracts don't have any postings, the program deletes the data that is created in Revenue Accounting directly. If the revenue contracts already have postings, the program reverses the postings to the general ledger to ensure that the data in the general ledger and Revenue Accounting can still be reconciled. All other data is deleted. Note To ensure that the data in Revenue Accounting and the general ledger are reconciled for revenue contracts which already have postings, the program only stores the data that is related to the original posting and the reversed posting to the general ledger in shadow tables (FARR_D_POSTING_S and FARR_D_RECKEY_S). There are objects and related database tables in Revenue Accounting that have no direct relation to a header ID. Therefore, this program can't delete entries from these database tables. Note If you used transition, you can rerun the Calculate Cumulative Catch-up Effect for Transition program (transaction FARR_TRANS_CATCHUP) with attribute Force New Run to ignore the existing entries in the FARR_D_TRANS_REC table.

"Run Actual Template Allocation - Projects Enter the receiver objects in the entry screen for template allocation to determine the overhead costs. When you carry out the allocation, the system does the following:Through the search rule you defined, the correct template is assigned to the receiver objectThe template finds the correct business process(es) or cost centers/activity typesIt calculates the quantities demanded/requiredIt sets the time period of the allocation and checks, if necessary, the activation requirements The result is a list of receiver and sender objects of the activity quantities and relevant costs (quantity*price). The price is calculated based on the valuation variant, which is tied to the receiver cost object for the simultaneous costing using the costing variant. If the receiving cost object is not tied with a costing variant for the simultaneous costing, then the planned price for the period is used for the valuation. The use of template allocations is one method to assign overhead costs. This method is unique for several reasons:Costs are not just allocated, but the system also determines the quantities that the respective receiver objects consume or utilize; costs are calculated based on the quantities and prices, and therefore more accurately determinedWorking with templates: the sender, quantities and activation time do not already exist, but can be dynamically determined through the template at the time of the calculationThe template uses functions defined by the user or already provided in the system to determine the needed data; these functions pull information already in fields or carry out complex algorithms from the operative data in the SAP system; they are created and maintained in the environment maintenanceSender objects can be business processes or cost centers/activity types.

Example For example, the number of purchase orders per sales orders serves as the process driver of the procurement process for a sales order processor. You can configure the Logistics Information System so that it updates the appropriate key figure for this sales order for each procurement transaction related to the order.

"Assessment Adjustment COA You can adjust assessments based on the distribution of the annual budget to the individual assessment contracts. Here the system simulates a settlement based on the current plan version (plan or actual costs) of the annual budget, and clears the paid assessments against the new expected payments due from the owners.

"Display Funds Center Group Group Editing In a group you can create more segment groups next to the direct combination of certain master data or assign groups that already exist as segment groups. This enables you to subdivide a complex group through segment groups into individual segments that makes it easier to understand. Note that a master record is only allowed to appear for each group once, including the subgroups. For the assigning of master data, the group editing also supports the entering of intervals. In this context you should note the following: If you have the master data selection of a group above an interval (for example, master data interval: AA to ZZ), then the new master data created, for which this interval definition applies, is automatically assigned to the group. Non-Year-Dependent Groups Master data groups are year-independent. You can limit the selection of valid master data in a group by entering a key date. If you are working with year-dependent master data in your organization, the validity period of an FM master record must lie within the validity period of the group. Otherwise this master record in the group is not taken into account. In such a case you receive the information No valid master record instead of the description of the master record. You define the key date of a group in the respective group editing transaction under Extras&nbsp;&nbsp;Default Values&nbsp;&nbsp;Structure . Change Documents You can specify that the editing of groups in change documents for each client and FM account assignment element (or set class) is logged.

You also use the groups in the component Controlling ( CO) for evaluation purposes in Report-Writer-Reports and to select groups in Controlling transactions. To do this you can subdivide the account assignment elements (commitment item, funds center, fund and functional area) into groups or Sets together following certain subdividing criteria. Note Master data groups, apart from named customer areas and functions are otherwise not supported in Funds Management.

This enables you to subdivide a complex group through segment groups into individual segments that makes it easier to understand. Note that a master record is only allowed to appear for each group once, including the subgroups. For the assigning of master data, the group editing also supports the entering of intervals. In this context you should note the following: If you have the master data selection of a group above an interval (for example, master data interval: AA to ZZ), then the new master data created, for which this interval definition applies, is automatically assigned to the group. Non-Year-Dependent Groups Master data groups are year-independent. You can limit the selection of valid master data in a group by entering a key date. If you are working with year-dependent master data in your organization, the validity period of an FM master record must lie within the validity period of the group. Otherwise this master record in the group is not taken into account. In such a case you receive the information No valid master record instead of the description of the master record. You define the key date of a group in the respective group editing transaction under Extras&nbsp;&nbsp;Default Values&nbsp;&nbsp;Structure . Change Documents You can specify that the editing of groups in change documents for each client and FM account assignment element (or set class) is logged.

"Create Configuration Profile You define different settings in configuration profiles for materials than for other configurable objects. You use the configuration profile to assign the configurable object to one or more variant classes. This links the object to the characteristics of the class for configuration. Note Note that the class is then assigned to the configurable object, not the profile. The profile only allows you to go to classification. You can define settings that affect the display options and scope of characteristics on the value assignment screen. You define these settings for each object, and they apply to the object wherever it is used. However, you can overwrite these settings for your user in the configuration editor. You can use an interface design to group characteristics together and define a sequence on the value assignment screen. You need to assign a name to an interface design to enable further maintenance in the configuration simulation. You can use the configuration profile to assign dependencies to a configurable object. You can only assign dependency nets to a configuration profile. If you assign actions and procedures to the configuration profile, you can manage them more easily because they are all in one place. For materials, you must also maintain configuration parameters for BOM explosion. Depending on the configuration parameters you set, other fields in the configuration profile are hidden or shown. You determine the status of the configurable object. You can also define settings for the status in Customizing. In Customizing, choose Configuration Profile &nbsp;&nbsp;Configurable Objects &nbsp;&nbsp;Material &nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain Status. You maintain configuration profiles for configurable objects to define central settings for configuring the object. You can create several configuration profiles with different settings for an object. If an object has several configuration profiles, you must select a profile during configuration. You can only make changes to a configuration with the profile that you first used to configure the object.

Settlement documentsSupplier billing documentsCustomer settlementsCustomer settlement listsExpense settlementsSettlement document lists When you cancel these settlement management documents, it is important to note what happens in the following cases: Settlement document, supplier settlement list, supplier billing document, customer settlement, expense settlement, customer settlement list Case 1: The document to be canceled has not yet been transferred to Financial Accounting (posted).If you cancel the document, a reversal document is created. The original document and the reversal document have status E (document completed upon cancellation) meaning that no follow-on documents can be generated for either document type (settlement document lists and accounting documents). Case 2: The document to be canceled has already been transferred to Financial Accounting. No settlement document list has yet been created for the document.When you cancel the document, a reversal document is created. This is automatically posted to Financial Accounting. The system takes neither the reversal document nor the original document into consideration when creating settlement document lists. Case 3: The document to be canceled has already been transferred to Financial Accounting. A settlement document list has already been created from the document.When you cancel the document, a reversal document and a settlement document list for the reversal document are created. When canceling document lists (customer settlement lists, settlement document lists), the system generates a reversal document list, by copying the document list, changing the settlement document type in the document header (for example, invoice in credit memo), and flagging the items with reversed credit/debit indicators. Furthermore, the system resets the status of the preceding documents when customer settlements or customer settlement lists are canceled, so that the documents are available again for creation of corresponding follow-on documents. For settlement documents and supplier settlement lists you can cancel both sides (supplier and customer) or just one side (supplier or customer). When you post a reversal document for a settlement document, only the lines for the active partner are created. During the statistics update, only the values for the active partner are updated in the reversal document. For a one-sided cancellation, it is also possible to cancel the second partner in a second step. Settlement document list Case 1: The settlement document list has not yet been transferred to Financial Accounting (posted).When you save the document to be canceled, a reversal document is not created. The document to be canceled is not posted. Case 2: The document to be canceled has already been transferred to Financial Accounting.When you save the document to be canceled, a reversal document list document is created. This is automatically posted to Financial Accounting. Furthermore, the system initializes the remuneration list numbers in the preceding documents, so that they are available again for the creation of a settlement document list. Single documents in supplier settlement listsA single settlement request contained in a supplier settlement list can only be canceled if the supplier settlement list has already been transferred to Financial Accounting. When the single document is canceled, a reversal document and a settlement document list are created for the reversal document. This corrects the balance of the accounts. unknown Settlement Management Reverse Supplier Settlement List",1,1,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.004,0.812,Other,,Other,Other,,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,,Other,0.02656709149607995,0.14043699231309362,0.023779534348023216,-0.07788752395172674,-0.08231416872857855,-0.12493408732918213,0.18311468233250133,-0.07542886549062097,-0.07719458713976537,0.004272430460756862,0.058256618636564346,-0.03248953515547071,0.028184327631501693,0.16416770778306164,-0.0679601997613392,0.1112831879859205,-0.046928339321657186,0.1969338229032026,-0.14765220518103672,0.028806123429589506,0.3315735151799485,0.035570291944030705,-0.06875053966003891,-0.058386986341152074,-0.027611916308614443,-0.1168086443660276,-0.0361771398428565,0.02658442400621497,-0.026816452310001265,0.02504035767495069,0.004365662581619368,0.030826774712250805,0.014292769791797593,-0.08677980215100384,0.015174116352615999,0.0461227037378579,-0.026364817400246977,0.009143500159433288,0.06359444580973013,0.024738758506766597,-0.06391611802427069,-0.003415694403654524,-0.1726760071135474,-0.04841694712597622,-0.009610966508493623,-0.13025226909409887,0.036169286984864275,-0.045539103671841163,-0.034619750343080916,-0.06596030334439723

"Cancel POBs - For Classic Contract Management Complete performance obligations after cancellation Revenue Accounting searches for canceled performance obligations. Usually these performance obligations have a finalization date and their statuses are set to In process. Then the system changes their statuses to Completed if the finalization date is earlier than the date when the search takes place. In the meantime, the cumulative amount and quantity for these performance obligations are adjusted according to the invoiced quantity and processed amount. Future cancellations If you specify a current or past finalization date, the cancellation is processed immediately. However, if you specify a future finalization date, you need to run program FARR_POB_CANCELLATION when the date comes. Therefore, we suggest that you run this program regularly if you have specified a future finalization date. Canceling time-based performance obligations For a time-based performance obligation, if the finalization date is in the past and the date is earlier than the start date, then the end date will be changed to the start date; if the date is later than the start date, then the finalization date will be set as the end date. if the finalization date is in the future and the finalization date is earlier than the end date, the end date will be set to the finalization date. At the same time, the deferral method of the time-based performance obligation will be set to method 1 Linear Distribution, Day-Specific, 365/366 Basis no matter what it was originally. Canceling linked performance obligations When a leading performance obligation is canceled, its linked performance obligation will also be canceled. Canceling a performance obligation in the pending review worklists Performance obligations with a Pending Reviewstatus go to the pending review worklists, either the worklist for regular monitoring, the worklist for contracts with errors, or the worklist for contracts with conflicts. When these performance obligations are canceled, the cancellation is not performed immediately. Even when they have been removed from the pending review worklists, the system does not automatically perform the cancellation. You need to run program FARR_POB_CANCELLATION manually. Changing the finalization date You can set or change the finalization date using method ORDER_DATA_TO_ARL of BAdI FARRIC_BADI_ORDER. Reversing a cancellation You can recover contracts that were canceled in the past. After you have reversed a cancellation in the operational system, Revenue Accounting removes the finalization date and changes the status of the performance obligations back to In process. The cumulative amount and quantity is also adjusted accordingly. After sales orders have been sent to Revenue Accounting and revenue accounting contracts have been created, you may need to cancel the contracts for certain reasons. As soon as the cancellation is performed in the sender components, a finalization date will be sent to Revenue Accounting as a sign to terminate the performance obligations. In the meantime, the operational document is locked with the Rejection status and is therefore canceled. In such a case, only processable fulfilled revenue accounting items and processable invoice revenue accounting items can be processed and sent to Revenue Accounting. Note The cancellation is performed at performance obligation level. Only after all performance obligations have been canceled can the revenue accounting contract be canceled. Example There is a sales order as follows: Contractual Price Invoiced Amount Recognized Amount Fulfillment (Percentage) Unbilled Receivable EUR 1,000 EUR 900 EUR 980 98% EUR 80 For some reasons, you decide to cancel this order, so you perform the cancellation in Sales and Distribution (SD) and SD sends a finalization date to Revenue Accounting. In Revenue Accounting, the contract is adjusted as follows: The contractual price is set to the invoiced amount. The invoiced amount is the total amount in billing, credit memo, and debit memo documents that are posted. The amounts in the documents with future posting dates are also included in the calculation. The fulfillment is set to 100%. The unbilled receivables amount is set to 0. Contractual Price Invoiced Amount Recognized Amount Fulfillment (Percentage) Unbilled Receivable Finalization Date EUR 900 EUR 900 EUR 900 100% EUR 0 The day you perform the cancellation.

"Clear Payments - Accounts Receivable - Russia, Clear Payments - Accounts Receivable - Ukraine SelectionIn the General Selections group box, you specify which company code you want to run the program for, and what the key date is. You can also restrict your selection by vendor or customer. In the Invoices and Payments group boxes, you can restrict the selection further. In the Clearing Options group box, you can make additional settings as to which documents can be cleared. Note Do not clear documents with different contract numbers within one clearing document. In the Run Mode group box, you specify whether you want to run the program in test mode; and if not, whether you want to it to create the clearing documents online or by using a batch input session. In the Clearing Documents group box, you specify what data to use in the clearing documents. Note In the Difference reason field, you can only enter a reason code that was defined without selecting the option of charging off differences via a separate G/L account. In the Clearing Rules group box, you specify what other settings the programs use when determining which clearing documents to use. OutputThe program first lists all open payments and open invoices. Below that it lists all payments and invoices that it has cleared (or, in test mode, that it can clear). For more information, see Clearing. Before you run the Deferred Tax Transfer program, you clear all open invoices against any matching payments, even if a payment does not cover the invoice in full (for example, if it is a partial payment or a down payment). Example On 1 August you post an invoice from TverSteel. On 10 August you pay the invoice, but you enter the payment without clearing it against the invoice. Since there is no link between the two documents, the system cannot recognize that you have paid the invoice.This program clears the invoice and the payment and thus enables the Deferred Tax Transfer program to recognize the VAT. There are two programs that automate the clearing of such payments, for accounts payable and accounts receivable respectively. Note The program is similar to the standard automatic clearing program, SAPF124. However, it allows you clear open items even if their balance is not zero.

"Create Allocation Table Selection of issue document schedule lines on the basis of specified criteriaYou can specify criteria for taking account of issue document schedule lines. Possible criteria are the distribution center, recipient, relevant period, and issue document type, for example. You can take existing warehouse stocks and open purchase orders into consideration as procurements that have already been completed. The selection procedure is the same as that for collective processing of due documents in Logistics Execution. Issue documents must also meet the following conditions: Multiple partial deliveries must be permittedThe issue document items cannot be assigned any special stockThe issue document items must not relate to batchesThe issue document items must not relate to delivery groups Determination of potential collective purchase order itemsOn the basis of your entries, the system selects the relevant issue document items and their schedule lines and adds up the quantities of each article for each distribution center to create potential collective purchase order schedule lines. A potential collective purchase order item is then created out of one or more collective purchase order schedule lines. Processing of collective purchase order items onlineYou can process potential collective purchase order items individually or in a worklist, and make any changes that may be necessary. For example, you can assign sources of supply or change the quantity of the schedule lines. Collective purchase order generationWhen you create collective purchase orders online, you first process the potential collective purchase order items and then start collective purchase order generation for one or more items. Collective purchase order with sub-items for supplementary logistics services (SLS)In a collective purchase order, you can order articles for which the supplier is to perform special services (for example, pre-packing). If you generate a collective purchase order for an article for which SLS data is defined, the SLS data is automatically included in the collective purchase order. If pre-packing is required, the system generates sub-items for every collective purchase order item. A sub-item is created for each recipient and the quantity allocated to that recipient. Quantity optimizingQuantity optmizing takes place during collective purchase order creation. You can use collective purchase orders to plan the distribution of merchandise. You can use a collective purchase order to combine the requirements of recipients, that may exist in the system as warehouse orders or sales orders, to create a single order for a supplier (“pull” process). Distribution data for a collective purchase order is kept in the system and you can then use this to control and monitor the distribution of merchandise to recipients.

"Maintain Recalls - Warranty Claim Processing You use this process if you want to enter and process warranty claims with reference to a recall. In a recall , products that have already been sold are recalled publicly to production so that a serious defects or technical errors in the object can be rectified. The costs of rectifying the defect are carried by the reimburser or claim processor , even if the warranty conditions are no longer fulfilled. We are therefore dealing here with a special form of warranty claim processing. The same applies to a technical campaign, but without the products being recalls publicly. For all products that have to be maintained or repaired anyway, the technical error is eliminated at the same time without the end customer necessarily knowing. Note There is no difference between processing with recalls and processing with technical campaigns in warranty claim processing.

"Display Vehicles In the list-editing for vehicles, you can select by general equipment data and also by vehicle-specific data. Vehicle identification (such as vehicle type, registration details) Technical vehicle data (such as engine type, number of cylinders) Transport relevant data (such as permitted gross weight, loading room volume) In the results list you can display the vehicle-specific data and the actual consumption data (such as average consumption). You determine which fields are displayed in the display variants. Note that the display of consumption data is very performance intensive since the values are calculated when generating the results list. Note During selection be aware of the special features for units (such as cm 3 , m 3 ). If you do not enter a unit , then the relevant SI unit (international industry standard) appears in the results list. If you do enter a unit then the results list appears in your desired unit. You can also enter the units as selection criteria if you do not want to use them for selection but rather only want to determine the units in the results list. unknown Measuring points and counters Display Vehicles",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,,Other,Measuring points and counters,,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,,Other,0.019417584992980873,0.11974037070797466,0.06476454937372465,-0.09865485043426131,-0.043491299991366576,-0.052733175038926286,-0.02680518972494547,0.06193687660318015,-0.02594466235017236,0.006715411517915054,0.027184470755705625,0.013361754345161266,-0.008960412589146562,0.046402248663690006,-0.021717460965788377,-0.006191041625936891,0.006502791342659065,0.03425094386868544,0.02623222811967761,0.0331805727200319,0.05126803455656438,0.03721862412744487,0.05743219435047026,-0.02165692741800848,0.045022457688559156,0.01852599154044371,-0.022353522385694373,0.059763627910234624,-0.08087195620323734,-0.021640671142443602,-0.034978471749980145,-0.03504711553203246,-0.026710082441755854,-0.027708274350447894,-0.06111858607192113,0.04821613754665395,-0.046023844838649575,-0.035008577607527194,-0.007656201987394456,0.09129812631387801,-0.0039343108010960115,-0.08845237689918595,-0.10571183631198497,0.04741876092025741,0.03588215963972734,-0.08776287509185247,-0.054847042748172835,-0.018637118180230373,-0.016304644893884685,0.01655744976593796

"Adjust Partner Settlements - Mass Run The adjustment run analyzes the customer receivables related to a trigger to see they are open, cleared, or written off. If an adjustment is necessary and the partner bears the risk for lack of payment (according to Customizing of the settlement rule), the run determines all billable and billed partner items related to the customer receivables. The system then creates new billable partner items with the amount of the reduction. If you do not want the reduction amount to be determined as a percentage of the open or cleared share of the customer receivable, you can implement your own logic for calculating the adjustment amount in event 1894. If the partner bears the default risk, then amounts already credited have to be reduced. The system makes the reductions automatically when you write off the receivables of the end customer. You also have the option to make reductions along with dunning activities when the end customer is dunned. In both cases, the system generates triggers. You have the system make the adjustment to partner settlement by processing these triggers in a separate adjustment run.

"Waive Acceptance Request You can use this function either to process a single FI document (individual short-term waiver) or several due dates for a subledger account (mass short-term waiver or mass remission). During mass processing, FI documents are not grouped together – this is sometimes the case with mass deferrals. The documents are then processed individually instead, by entering the invoice reference, and then saved in the database. If you want to process documents with different currencies at the same time during mass processing, the data saved to the database may be inconsistent. In this is the case, the program only executes the short-term waiver/remission in the local currency. A short-term waiver and remission functions as an acceptance request. If you enter a short-term waiver (a remission), the system copies the original document specified and creates the short-term waiver (the remission). This is saved in the system as a parked document. The short-term waiver (the remission) has the opposite +/- sign to the original item. The parked document must undergo an approval procedure like a “normal” acceptance request. The posting can take place after the short-term waiver (remission) has been approved. Note As of 4.01A, it is only possible to waive a partial amount of an acceptance request. Short-term waivers and remissions are cleared automatically when they are posted. The system clears the original document (outgoing payment/acceptance request or the posted down payment) with the short-term waiver or remission. If more short-term waivers refer to the original document, these are also considered and cleared. Of course, documents are only cleared automatically when the balance between the original document and the document(s) that refer to it is 0 in the company code currency. The short-term waiver of an open claim means that the entitlement due is not pursued further. The difference between a short-term waiver and a remission is the following: with a short-term waiver, the entitlement itself is not waived, whereas this is the case with a remission. The prerequisites for using short-term waivers and remissions are defined by law. unknown Funds Management-Specific Postings Waive Acceptance Request",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,Other,Other,Other,,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,,Other,0.008806626409219346,0.059289879467413965,0.0072319492412890925,-0.028225065472962798,-0.019656550719667095,-0.03206985672211187,0.02626436341216347,0.010704759014179886,-0.02043013184661134,-0.02308103791494831,0.002728202548233007,-0.011521684657784238,0.011963456250772,0.024955587106335306,0.01231971867923162,0.005213494019328271,0.0009065395208238531,0.00437078178187993,-0.012811107033990304,0.008991563557020467,0.022959108010397543,0.02473554047804964,-0.0016376818749580327,0.000121716646569977,-0.008314258215004443,0.010631308115255943,-0.00898936114761093,0.006735074416139049,-0.029632303414213808,-0.0034648168860202696,-0.034296777959355165,0.0012382049969778637,-0.0062776349464056,0.021310994222453795,0.03828585952262303,0.013686857796192045,-0.010434432787270539,-0.029063705749465412,0.009995573115067527,0.02748777741277136,0.010838103190697158,0.0050619962866504525,-0.12405085949076507,0.04239132370178363,-0.0221504787695412,-0.08034980336743729,0.058847389978234875,-0.004631082466679193,0.0194210791521047,-0.05182141406058356

"Display Group - For Freight List You can combine outbound deliveries into groups. An outbound delivery can belong to several groups. You can create grouped outbound deliveries manually. When you process a delivery due list, the system combines all the outbound deliveries that it creates into one group. Group number All grouped deliveries are identified by a group number. You can use this number to access the group and to find the individual outbound deliveries that belong to that group. Maintaining the group To create, change, or display a group of deliveries manually, start at shipping in the initial menu.

"Schedule Migration of Purchasing Data for Analytics You can use this app to do the following: Create and schedule jobs to migrate purchasing data for analytics. You can use the job template Schedule Migration of Purchasing Data for Analytics. You can create a new job by choosing the New button. On the New Job screen, you can start a job immediately or you can schedule it to start later. If you schedule a job, the system carries it out in the background. You can define whether a job should recur and set up a recurrence schedule. You can choose one of the following migration options: Initial Load: Migrates all the purchasing records. Reprocess Records: Migrates the remaining purchasing records which failed to migrate during initial load. Delta Load: Migrates selective purchasing records. Purchasing records can be filtered for purchase order date, suppliers, and purchase orders. You must also input the following parameters: Log Level: Select the log level, if you want detailed logs for select Advanced, for simple logs select Basic. Tolerance Limit: Define the maximum number of purchasing records that can fail to migrate during migration process. If this number exceeds during migration process, then the overall migration will be flagged as failed. Number of Tasks: Define number of tasks in which the whole job should be divided. Package Size: Define number of records to be processed in one task. Server Group: Enter the server group name. As a new customer, you must use the option Activate Performance Optimization to enable performance optimization. If this app is not executed with this option, then performance for analytics apps won’t be optimized. Display the results of scheduled jobs in the Application Jobs list. You can, for example, see whether a job was carried out successfully or it was canceled. You can filter the list based on different criteria, such as date, job description, and the person who created the job. Copy an existing job to schedule a new job. You can then modify the copied job based on your requirements. Check the logs of every scheduled job in the Application Jobs list. You can now optimize performance for some of the purchasing analytics apps by migrating the purchasing data (purchase orders and scheduling agreements).

"Execute Securities Account Transfer The securities account transfer takes the transfer amount at book value from the source securities account and posts it to the target securities account. The system generates the associated flows depending on the position management procedure. For more information see Position Management Procedure. Also see the documentation in the Customizing of Treasury and Risk Management under Transaction Manager → General Settings → Accounting → Settings for Position Management → Define Position Management Procedure. You can display the quantities of the security ID number in the source and target securities account before the securities account transfer. You can display the source and target securities account cash flows including the securities account transfer. Within a company code, you can transfer positions at their book values from one securities account to another. The securities account transfer can affect the general ledger as well as the subledger since, by changing the securities account for a position (= change in the subledger accounting), you can change both the valuation class and the account assignment reference, if the target securities account has a different account assignment reference in the position indicator to that of the source securities account (= changes in the general ledger accounts).

"Quotation monitoring You can use this function to monitor quotations with premium changes and inform external systems whether a customer has accepted the quotation for premium change. Quotation monitoring only takes place in the Direct Payer business scenario application. Quotations for premium changes are offers made to the customer, with which the insurance premium is to be adjusted automatically at defined intervals (yearly, for example). Adjustments of this type can include yearly premium increase at a specific percentage rate, or by a calculated amount. The customer is free to accept or refuse these quotations. If the customer is a direct payer, he/she can decide whether to accept the quotation from the insurance company by paying the insurance premium: If the customer pays the adjusted premium, even partially, he/she accepts the quotation; if he/she does not pay, or only pays the previous amount, the quotation is refused. The system defines the (partial) payment of the quotation above the clearing of the quotation item. After a number of days defined in Customizing, the system defines the non-acceptance of the quotation as the customer not having paid (or only having paid the previous amount), thus not clearing the quotation item. Quotation monitoring checks the acceptance status and transfers the result of the check to the information container. unknown Collections and Disbursements Quotation monitoring",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,,Other,Other,,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,,Other,0.011087625109412082,0.07124040157683753,0.01445057030848061,-0.04118525157369835,-0.021104085383656667,-0.016349922225943458,0.03013059974550976,0.012953370468610585,-0.017938250646321,-0.01782067524788566,0.0020376583946888635,0.03210033134394722,0.0020984671773130615,-0.006481044550066452,0.03205679657339587,-0.0021741865009043478,-0.03790141971050479,-0.03229356081733972,-0.018957877545221234,0.004000632188092303,0.017123613342079406,-0.005518253793312464,0.005233575132541882,-0.012424557374372817,0.0009836555297364907,0.07648111461633328,-0.0269228339618331,0.01701562672471736,0.03717524388506285,-0.019198578474164302,0.0033869099518896058,0.0036961228031806305,0.030185157251350823,0.032974708623152646,0.0008152738555940324,-0.0007775628408904168,0.03819869265165358,-0.004378938706634752,0.007949975429696467,0.05748813277771014,0.04611097658747841,0.03792202986238818,-0.0668348627627469,-0.0045331572347411635,0.008565320900072492,0.00490533359007035,-0.025961205848150648,0.027873440905343407,0.02728807054757902,0.00015499597499013838

"Freight Booking Execution Monitoring - Overview Page This overview page is based on two CDS views (data sources), each generating different cards. The following features are available with data source 1 (C_FRTBKGEXECUTIONSTSQ_CDS CDS view): Life Cycle Status AnalysisYou can view the number of execution-relevant freight bookings, grouped by freight booking life cycle status. Execution-relevant freight bookings have the execution status In Execution (03) and have a departure event but no arrival event at the final destination.You can see the number of freight bookings for each life cycle status (Draft (00), New (01), or In Process (02)), sorted in descending order. Execution Block AnalysisYou can review all freight bookings with an execution block, grouped by execution block reason. This helps you to determine the most common causes of execution blocking and take the appropriate action. The list is sorted in descending order.You specify execution block reasons in the TM Freight Booking transaction; if you haven’t done this, the system automatically creates them, based on the blocking category. Planning Block AnalysisYou can review all freight bookings with a planning block, grouped by planning block reason. This helps you to determine the most common causes of planning blocking and take the appropriate action. The list is sorted in descending order.You specify execution block reasons in the TM Freight Booking transaction; if you haven’t done this, the system automatically creates them, based on the blocking category. Delayed Freight Bookings in TransitYou can view freight bookings that are delayed in transit, that is, if their latest, time-relevant event is delayed (both the expected and actual date and time fields are available and the event status is Reported). The delay is the time difference between the actual date and the expected date.You can see the total number of freight bookings and then drill down to view details such asFreight Booking ID, Means of Transport, Gross Weight, and Delay. You specify the units as parameters in the relevant CDS query view.You can also navigate directly to the related freight booking transaction by selecting the first line or header line of the details view. The following features are available with data source 2 (C_FRTBKGEXECUTIONQUERY_CDS CDS view): Blocking DiscrepanciesYou can review the discrepant freight booking events that led to a block, sorted by event code and discrepancy type (such as delivery of item, late, or delay). The discrepancy type with the most blocking events is at the top. Non-Blocking DiscrepanciesYou can see the discrepant freight booking events that didn’t result in a block, sorted by event code and discrepancy type (such as arrival at destination, departure, or loading end). The discrepancy type with the most non-blocking events is at the top. Carrier On Time PerformanceYou can view the percentage of freight bookings that each carrier delivered on time. You can also see this expressed in numbers, for example, 6 / 14 were on time. A freight booking is on time if all its events are classed as on time, otherwise it is classed as delayed. This helps you identify the most efficient carriers.The calculation for all the on time performance cards takes into account all time-relevant events where both expected and actual date and time fields are available, and where the event status is Reported. Location On Time PerformanceThis shows the percentage of on time freight booking events for each location, sorted by the transportation order events on time ratio. The lowest percentage is at the top. You can also see this expressed in numbers, for example, 6 / 8 events were on time. This helps you understand how individual locations are performing. Activity On Time PerformanceYou can review the percentage of on time freight booking events for each event code (such as loading or unloading), with the lowest number at the top. You can also see this expressed in numbers, for example, 12 / 27 events took place on time. You can use this information to identify potential bottlenecks. Unexpected EventsYou can monitor unexpected events that took place within the freight booking, grouped by event code (such as accident or delay), with the highest number at the top. This information may prove vital in taking preventative measures to avoid such events in the future.

"Display Master Data Groups The properties of a master data group always refer to a business partner. You can group master data at the level of the contract account or at the level of the contract. During dunning by collection strategy, you can group the master data of business partners in master data groups. The dunning activity run then considers the group as a whole. This means that the system performs the necessary dunning activities separately for each master data group. Example The dunning activity run creates one collection work item for each master data group.

"Create Funds Center Group Group Editing In a group you can create more segment groups next to the direct combination of certain master data or assign groups that already exist as segment groups. This enables you to subdivide a complex group through segment groups into individual segments that makes it easier to understand. Note that a master record is only allowed to appear for each group once, including the subgroups. For the assigning of master data, the group editing also supports the entering of intervals. In this context you should note the following: If you have the master data selection of a group above an interval (for example, master data interval: AA to ZZ), then the new master data created, for which this interval definition applies, is automatically assigned to the group. Non-Year-Dependent Groups Master data groups are year-independent. You can limit the selection of valid master data in a group by entering a key date. If you are working with year-dependent master data in your organization, the validity period of an FM master record must lie within the validity period of the group. Otherwise this master record in the group is not taken into account. In such a case you receive the information No valid master record instead of the description of the master record.

"Database Listing of Totals Records (Classic View) - Reporting Logic To enable deep analysis of consolidated data, the report provides an interface for accessing data of any granularity that exists in the consolidation database from the perspective of consolidation groups. Based on your specified fiscal year, period, and consolidation group, you can choose to display amounts for all relevant FS items in local currencies, group currency, and transaction currencies, as well as information on posting levels, consolidation units, partner units, and all accounting master data or attributes. From any displayed amounts, you can drill through to the Display Group Journal Entries - With Reporting Logic app to view the posting details at line item level. The technical name of the CDS data view for this report is CCSTOTALSRR01Q. By adding a prefix 2C, you can derive the analytical query name for the respective report. Note These reports are deprecated with SAP S/4HANA 2023 and will be removed in a future release. Please switch to the successor app: Group Data Analysis (W0135). For more information, see Group Data Analysis. With the introduction of a new reporting logic, this app is only applicable to you if you're using an initial release lower than SAP S/4HANA 1909 and haven't migrated to the new reporting logic. If you're using an initial release 1909 or higher, please use the Group Data Analysis app instead. For more information, see Old Reporting Logic and SAP Note 2659672 .

"Clear G/L Accounts - For Ledger Group If you set the Clearing Specific to Ledger Groups indicator for a G/L account managed on an open item basis, ledger group-specific postings can be made to this account. In this way, you have a ledger group-specific view of the account. Clearing is also performed for specific ledger groups. This means that: Items that you have posted in a specific ledger group can only be processed further within the same ledger group. If you have posted provisions, for example, to specific ledger groups, you also clear those provisions in the same ledger groups. Posting and Clearing In the following transactions, you can make postings for specific ledger groups: Enter G/L Account Document for Ledger Group (FB50L) and General Posting for Ledger Group (FB01L). In the following transactions, you can perform clearing for specific ledger groups: Manual clearing:Clear G/L Account for Ledger Group (FB1SL) and Post with Clearing for Ledger Group (FB05L)You use both of these transactions in the same way as transactions FB1S and FB05. Automatic clearing: Automatic Clearing Specific to Ledger Groups (F13L) Reporting G/L Account List (Transaction S_ALR_87012328) In the G/L account list, you can see whether the G/L account displayed uses open item management specific to ledger groups. To select all G/L accounts with open item management specific to ledger groups, you can use ledger group-specific clearing as the selection criterion for custom selections, provided you have made the corresponding settings in the logical database SDF (see SAP Note 1086335). Account Detective (Transaction S_ALR_87101048 or Report RFAUDI30) The Account Detective report uses the Clearing Specific to Ledger Groups column in the G/L account list. G/L Account Line Item List (Transaction FAGLL03) Here, you can display the line items that were posted to an account with open item management specific to ledger groups. In the entry view, you only see those items that were posted to the leading ledger or to a ledger group containing the leading ledger. The general ledger view lists all items that were posted to the specified G/L account in the specified ledger. The line item list has a Ledger Group column. You can sort the line items by ledger group. Note You cannot use the G/L account line item list from classic General Ledger Accounting (transaction FBL3N) for accounts with open item management specific to ledger groups. Archiving You can only archive cleared items. Transporting the Indicator Value It is possible to use the ALE interface to transport the indicator value Clearing Specific to Ledger Groups. Constraints Sample Accounts The sample account method (transactions FSM*, such as the creation of sample accounts) as well as the transfer of G/L account master data using transactions FS15 and FS16 do not support the Clearing Specific to Ledger Groups indicator since these transactions use older screen technology. For this reason, you have to set the indicator manually after editing the master data. Reporting When you call the G/L Account List (RFSKVZ00) program or the G/L account list query, you can only select G/L accounts using the characteristic Clearing Specific to Ledger Groups once you have made the corresponding settings in the logical database SDF. These settings are described in SAP Note 1086335. You use clearing specific to ledger groups if you perform parallel accounting using the ledger approach (and not the account approach). Clearing and making postings specific to ledger groups supports you with your closing tasks. You can use the function for all items that, due to parallel accounting, are posted to multiple ledgers and valuated differently in those ledgers, in particular for provisions (such as provisions for commission or process risks, or provisions for creating and checking year-end closing).

"Create Grid Recording grid hierarchiesYou can map grid hierarchies in the system by specifying a higher-level grid for a grid. You can evaluate these hierarchies when schedules are created in order to create overall schedules for the different grids. Distribution grid across several control areasIf a distribution grid extends across several control areas managed by different control area operators, each part of a distribution grid that is located in the area covered by a control area must be managed as a separate grid in the system for settlement purposes.

"Change Inventory Sampling Procedure This component reduces the time and cost of a physical inventory considerably by counting only the stock of individual materials and carrying out an extrapolation to arrive at an estimated count result for all units of stock managed in the system (stock management units). The more materials a company has, the more costly it is to carry out a physical inventory by counting all stocks. The principle of extrapolation during sample taking is also used in quality inspection in the system: only one particular sample is inspected. The result is then applied to the entire quantity. However, such conclusions (from several counts of all stock management units) are only allowed when certain criteria are fulfilled: The scope of the stock management units involved in the physical inventory must be large enough. The selection of stock management units to be counted must be “representative”. Mathematical/statistical processes are used to perform the inventory sampling: A sample to be counted is randomly selected from the stock management units subject to physical inventory. The size of the sample depends on the probable degree of confidence that is valid for the projection of individual count results on all the stock management units involved. On the basis of the posted count results, the system carries out an extrapolation for all the stock management units included in the physical inventory. The inventory sampling is considered successful, if there is only a small deviation between the extrapolated value and the book value and a high probability that the extrapolation result contains only a minor error. In the case of a successful inventory sampling, it is assumed that the estimated variances from the book inventory are so small that they can be safely ignored. As in the case of a “standard” physical inventory, only the stock of the elements actually counted is adjusted. The stock of the remaining stock management units remains unchanged. If an inventory sampling is not successful, a complete physical inventory must be carried out for the stock management units not counted. unknown Inventory Management Change Inventory Sampling Procedure",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,,Other,Inventory Management,,Other,"This component reduces the time and cost of a physical inventory considerably by counting only the stock of individual materials and carrying out an extrapolation to arrive at an estimated count result for all units of stock managed in the system (stock management units).

"Process Returned Bills of Exchange, Returned Bill of Exchange Payable This function enables you to have the system process returned bills of exchange payableautomatically. We are concerned here with the processing of bills of exchange payable that a business partner or his or her bank submits to your house banks for cashing. There are two different procedures here: Payment advice note to the house bank:Before the due date of the bill of exchange payable, a letter (or DME file in France) is generated to advise the bank Which bill of exchange is expected to be submitted and how the bank should go about processing the bill. The house bank then processes the bill according to the payment advice note and debits the account of the drawee. Not all bills of exchange are paid or settled in full. In such cases, the house bank notifies either the bank where the bill was presented, or the bank from which the bill was presented to the drawee’s bank for payment. Payment advice note to the house bank:The house bank informs the drawee which bills of exchange were presented for payment, either in the form of written confirmation or by data medium exchange, (DME). The payee checks the details supplied by the house bank and decides whether the bills of exchange are to be paid in full, refused, or only part-paid. The house bank, having received the decision regarding payment proceeds as is described. The function returned bills of exchange payable deals with the necessary operations. Bill of exchange selection:Depending on whether the payment advice note at the bank is in the form of a DME file, (only in France) the bills of exchange can be selected by means of the bill of exchange liability account or or via a DME file. When you select via the DME file, the payment advice note from the bank is imported and checked against the bill holdings. Processing of selected bill of exchange:To start with, you select the bills of exchange that you want the bank to act upon. Those bills of exchange selected via a DME file, (only in the case of France) are already flagged. This is because we can assume that they are to appear at the bank in the payment advice note. Next there are decisions regarding payment that need to be addressed.

"Run Actual Template Allocation - Profitability Analysis Enter the receiver objects in the entry screen for template allocation to determine the overhead costs. When you carry out the allocation, the system does the following:Through the search rule you defined, the correct template is assigned to the receiver objectThe template finds the correct business process(es) or cost centers/activity typesIt calculates the quantities demanded/requiredIt sets the time period of the allocation and checks, if necessary, the activation requirements The result is a list of receiver and sender objects of the activity quantities and relevant costs (quantity*price). The price is calculated based on the valuation variant, which is tied to the receiver cost object for the simultaneous costing using the costing variant. If the receiving cost object is not tied with a costing variant for the simultaneous costing, then the planned price for the period is used for the valuation. The use of template allocations is one method to assign overhead costs. This method is unique for several reasons:Costs are not just allocated, but the system also determines the quantities that the respective receiver objects consume or utilize; costs are calculated based on the quantities and prices, and therefore more accurately determinedWorking with templates: the sender, quantities and activation time do not already exist, but can be dynamically determined through the template at the time of the calculationThe template uses functions defined by the user or already provided in the system to determine the needed data; these functions pull information already in fields or carry out complex algorithms from the operative data in the SAP system; they are created and maintained in the environment maintenanceSender objects can be business processes or cost centers/activity types.

"Execute Settlement - For AuC During the under construction phase, assets can be managed in a normal asset master record or in an asset master record with line item management, depending on the scope of functions you need. As a result, the transfer from the asset under construction to completed fixed assets can be handled in one of two ways: Summary transfer from a normal asset master record to the receiver assets (transaction type 348/349) As an asset master record with line item management, which you settle by line item to the receivers Recommendation For extensive investment measures, we recommend using the Investment Management (IM) component. Using the IM component, you can manage a capital investment in parallel: for financial accounting purposes as an asset under construction, and for controlling purposes as an internal order or project.For more information, see the documentation for the Investment Management component. Assets under Construction Without Line Item Management The procedure corresponds to the procedure for the transfer between two assets within the same company code (see Posting an Intracompany Asset Transfer (Splitting an Asset)). Before carrying out a full transfer of an asset under construction, you have to reverse any down payments that were posted in the current fiscal year. Down payments are ignored for a partial transfer. For transfers to be displayed in the asset history sheet as acquisitions to fixed assets, you use special transaction types for the transfer of assets under construction. Example Transfer of Asset under Construction to Capitalized Asset Assets under Construction with Line Item Management In Asset Accounting, you can accumulate costs under purely technical aspects in an asset under construction. You do not need to consider the later creation of fixed assets at this point. During the construction phase, you can accumulate all acquisitions for an investment in a single asset. These acquisitions include External activity (acquisition from vendor) Internal activity (internal order) Stock material (withdrawal from warehouse) When using this ""collective management"" of assets under construction, it is possible to manage the individual acquisitions as open items over the course of several fiscal years. At completion, the line items must be cleared and then distributed to the various receivers. The system activates open item management when an asset under construction is created, if you set the corresponding indicator in the asset class. In addition, for open item settlement, you have to assign a settlement profile to the company codes involved (in Customizing for Asset Accounting under Transactions&nbsp;&nbsp; Capitalization of Assets under Construction&nbsp;&nbsp;Define/Assign Settlement Profiles). The main function of the settlement profile is to specify the allowed receivers (such as, assets or cost centers). Example For an example, see Graphic: Line Item Settlement Distribution Rules Line item settlement is carried out by using distribution rules. Distribution rules are asset-specific. Several distribution rules form a distribution rule group. You can assign these groups to one or more line items of an asset. Distribution rules consist of a distribution key and a receiver. The distribution key can be equivalence numbers or percentage rates. In this way, you can distribute any number of combinations of line items to any number of combinations of receivers. Example Distribution rule group with percentage distributionDistribution proportion Receiver (Asset) 10% 10531 -1000 20% 10531 -2000 40% 10533 -0000 30% 10533 -1000 Distribution rule group with equivalence numbers1 : 2 : 4 : 3 Distribution by ledger group You have to set up the distribution of line items as specific to ledger groups, since the system writes one line item for each ledger group. Note It is only possible to maintain distribution rules in the view without the depreciation areas, because it is only possible to enter the distribution rule also for each ledger group. If in transaction Settlement of Asset Under Construction (AIAB) you want to display additional depreciation areas in the line item list, choose the Show/Hide Depreciation Areas pushbutton. Receiver You must settle those parts of the asset under construction that require capitalization to capitalized assets. Those parts that do not require capitalization (expense) can be settled as adjustment postings to cost centers. You can specify a cost element in the account determination in Asset Accounting for this settlement to cost centers. However, you should be aware that you can only settle acquisitions from the current fiscal year to CO receivers. This restriction applies since acquisitions from previous fiscal years should not have an effect on expenses of later fiscal years. In addition, it is possible to settle to general ledger accounts. However, these G/L accounts cannot be defined with additional account assignment to a CO object. Therefore, you should first settle to clearing accounts, if necessary, and then transfer the values to the corresponding accounts in Financial Accounting. Investment Support Just as it does for completed assets, the system calculates depreciation and interest for the asset under construction. This calculation is based on the depreciation terms specified in the asset master record or in the asset class. It is also possible to manage investment support on the asset under construction. However, it is not possible to transfer investment support that was posted to the asset under construction in the year of capitalization. The investment support cannot be transferred to a completed asset, because you cannot tell if the investment support applies to acquisitions in the current fiscal year or earlier fiscal years. Therefore, you have to reverse the investment support manually before the settlement. After the settlement, you post it to the completed asset. Carrying Out Settlement You can set up the settlement rules at a given point in time, and then carry out the corresponding update of the line items at a later point in time, since a separate transaction exists for the actual settlement (transaction AIBU). This transaction triggers the settlement posting for the selected assets under construction, and creates the necessary posting documents. During this process, the system automatically separates the transfer of asset acquisitions from prior fiscal years from acquisitions that took place in the year of capitalization. When the prior-year acquisitions are transferred, (special) depreciation and investment support measures are also transferred proportionally. The system automatically generates carryforward postings for partial capitalization. The standard report List of Origins of Asset Charges (RAHERK01) enables you to trace the origin of the items in the capitalized asset back to the original asset under construction. An asset that you produce yourself has two stages in its life that are relevant for accounting from the point of view of your company: Under construction phase Useful life Generally, an asset has to be shown in different balance sheet items, depending on the phase that it is in. Therefore, it is necessary to manage the asset as a separate object or asset master record during the construction phase. The transition between these two phases is called ""capitalization of the asset under construction"" in the following.

"Run Actual Indirect Activity Allocation - Profitability Analysis Performing Assessment and Indirect Activity Allocation Given that cycles are allocated in assessment and in indirect activity allocation, the same procedure is executed for both. You can allocate cycles online or in the background. Recommendation Assessment cycles that process large amounts of data should always be executed in the background in order to avoid bottlenecks. It is recommended that you do not execute more than one large cycle in the same job step. You can perform cycles sequentially or in parallel. If you want to prevent specific cycles from being performed in parallel (such as ones that are dependent on other ones), you must assign these particular cycles to the same cycle run group (see also Processing Cycle Run Groups). If your controlling area and your operating concern use different currencies, the system translates the values during the transfer. For actual costs, the system uses the mean exchange rate (exchange rate type M). The default setting translates the values using the rate valid on the last day of the period. By choosing Extras&nbsp;&nbsp;Value Date in assessment, you can also enter a date on which the currency translation should take place.In planning, the exchange rate type is taken from the definition of the plan version. The system always uses the rate valid for the first day of the period. Line items are written, being credited to the cost centers/processes and debited from the profitability segments. To display these line items, use the information system or choose Assessment&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview or Indirect Activity Allocation&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview. In costing-based CO-PA, the receiver data is transferred to value fields in CO-PA. Records are also are created in CO-PA with record type D. For the allocation of actual data, the posting date is the last day of the period. For the allocation of planning data, the posting date is the first day of the period. If you repeat a cycle during a period, data already posted is canceled automatically before the cycle is run a second time. Note Along with the cycle name and the initial data, the sender version is also part of the unique key of a plan cycle. This means that you can carry out the same cycle repeatedly with different sender versions. Hence nothing is canceled if you change the sender version in the cycle definition. If you want to manually cancel a cycle, choose Indirect Activity Allocation&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancel or Assessment&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancel. Note Cancellation is always carried out at the line item level. Once you have archived your data or have deleted the line items in either Profitability Analysis or Cost Center Accounting, you can no longer reverse the cycles. You can check the allocation results (such as the sender and receiver information) by creating detailed lists (sender and receiver lists as well as journal lists) in which to record the results. To specify which detail lists should be created, select the detail lists indicator and choose List selection. If you perform allocation in the background, the system generates the following spool files:A spool file is generated for the basic list, the segment list, and for the receiver and sender lists if appropriate.If applicable, a separate spool file is generated for the journal list.If applicable, a separate spool file is generated for the expert trace. Moreover, you can display a runtime analysis (expert trace) or any messages while allocation is being executed. See also Results of Periodic Repostings or Periodic Allocations. The message section of the lists also contains information about which summarization levels were read (see also Defining Summarization Levels). You can improve performance significantly by defining suitable summarization levels. You can find more detailed explanations by double-clicking the individual messages. You can make the following settings by choosing Edit&nbsp;&nbsp;Settings:Enter the display variant for detail listsSpecify the strategy for database selectionEnter the name under which the detail lists are to be stored with the allocation resultsRecord the run log and the runtime analysisDetermine system behavior when an error has occurred during the collective execution of cycles. One main difference with allocating planned overhead is that a cycle cannot be defined by the name and initial date alone. Instead, the sender version is also an essential part of the key for the cycle to run. This allows you to reuse the same cycle for different planned versions. All you need to do is change the sender version, without having to define a completely new cycle for each version. Performing Template Allocation For information on performing template allocation, see the section on Executing Template Allocations in the online documentation for Activity-Based Costing (CO-OM-ABC). To transfer cost center costs or process costs to Profitability Analysis at the end of the period, execute assessment, indirect activity allocation or template allocation. unknown Profitability Analysis Profitability Analysis Run Actual Indirect Activity Allocation - Profitability Analysis",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,Other,Other,Other,,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,Profitability Analysis,Other,0.028279479218245033,0.1959745766410993,0.09685570095923673,-0.135650047546604,-0.09518240469319872,-0.1257930572781428,-0.08834460664551431,0.10896404606277972,-0.08755716449601891,0.24357541253102719,-0.08088321307941537,-0.08145654552069355,0.007574973380688561,0.05936255618887078,0.049032035287966826,0.013945221330650553,0.013575199982657488,0.004620940181711599,0.017484331837182406,-0.056695064505982176,-0.06737731757409061,-0.15664848343088936,0.01657617149689873,-0.007398155518965857,0.16587148547405223,0.0013430307539804905,-0.06181790883623402,-0.11361825683504291,-0.021231320475854198,-0.0777177085420834,-0.011399881363451186,0.006422315716963547,-0.012479753451463191,-0.0861526970179902,0.003234165048713954,0.11239576163846729,-0.08333102017419405,0.07361443675701007,0.21284335061378337,-0.05672935214208439,0.07545790503550308,-0.08639625642081131,-0.08064040535789131,-0.16739982375908144,0.05343048369459906,0.02554502515355429,0.09011478552432782,0.010719706226336296,0.001735477611921733,0.016815169713164973

"My Collection Worklist You can use the following individual functions for processing worklists: Process Worklist Items When you process worklist items that belong to different collection groups, when you start the worklist you have to select the group or groups for which you want to process worklist items. For your worklists you can configure whether all groups are always to be displayed. In the standard system, the first time you call up the worklist the first 30 open worklist items with the highest priority are displayed. You can configure this number. You can display and hide the worklist items completed in the lower screen area via Worklist → Display/Hide Completed Items Once you have completed the open worklist items, you can get the next open worklist items assigned to you by choosing Worklist → Get Further Items You can display other worklists.For example, you can display the worklist of another collection specialist or the worklist of a collection group. If you know the business partner and the collection segment, you can process the receivables of the business partner by choosing Process → Process Receivables → Other Business Partner You can see all existing worklist items for a selected business partner by choosing Worklist →Entries for Business Partner . The two examples below illustrate typical cases in which you see further items of a business partner that are not in your current worklist. A business partner exists with different numbers in two separate FI systems. You have defined in the master record that this involves the same business partner. A business partner exists with the same number in two different clients of an FI system. You have assigned these clients in Customizing to different collection segments, so that both items appear in the worklist of different specialists. For information on processing and completing receivables, see Processing Receivables . Assign Worklist Itemsunder Process → Assign If worklist items have been assigned to you incorrectly, you can remove this assignment or assign the worklist items to another collection specialist. The items then disappear from your worklist. If worklist items have been subsequently assigned to you, these items influence your worklist as follows: The worklist item assigned has a higher priority than the worklist item with the lowest priority in your current worklist: To see the item in the worklist, choose with the quick info text Refresh Worklist . The worklist item assigned has a lower priority than the worklist item with the lowest priority in your current worklist. To see the item, choose Worklist → Get Further Items Display Additional Informationunder Extras Statistics Listing of the number of open and completed worklist items per collection group and priority. The completed items are subdivided into items where the business partner was reached and items where the business partner was not reached. The statistics are created for all worklist items assigned to you. Valuation According to Collection Strategy Listing of the collection rules and their number of points Due Date Grid Graphical overview of the receivables for a worklist item Recreation of the Worklist Items for a Business Partner Transaction UDM_GENWL_BP If you have assigned your business partner to a new collection profile, this change is not considered until you create the worklists again. With this function, you recreate the current worklist items for a business partner without creating new worklists. You should only use the recreation of worklist items for a business partner as an exception since the function is not designed for processing mass data. When you recreate the worklist items for a business partner, the items already completed are deleted, and the current worklist items are deleted and recalculated and recreated based on the existing receivables. You can also start the function in test mode, meaning that the recreation of the worklist items is logged without changes being made. As collection manager you are responsible for one or more collection groups. You can use the same functions as a collection specialist. However, in contrast to the worklist of a collection specialist, you always see all worklist items that correspond to the search criteria entered. For example, you can display all worklist items for your collection group or all worklist items of a collection specialist. Typically, a collection manager has the following tasks: Determination of the degree of processing of a collection group To do this, select all worklist items of the collection group and choose Extras → Display Statistics . You receive a breakdown by collection specialist, collection group, and priority for the open and completed worklist items. The completed items are subdivided into items where the business partner was reached and items where the business partner was not reached. Manual distribution of worklist items to collection specialists Select the worklist items not assigned for a collection group. Select the items and assign them to collection specialists. With this function, as a collection specialist you can process your worklists in a predefined order. Your worklist items represent business partners in a collection segment. A worklist item describes the receivables due from a business partner. The following are some of the fields displayed for a worklist item: Business Partner Amounts, such as Outstanding, Amount To Be Collected Rating Priority As a collection manager, you can manage the worklists of collection specialists and collection groups. unknown Collections Management My Collection Worklist",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,Other,Other,Other,,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,,Other,0.01644260795744349,0.14084803922880737,0.016108559253661885,-0.05699166616315831,-0.020481327735478796,-0.03458749178185714,0.026519046185365987,0.08353096449497605,-0.07536937117425885,-0.06291046943593105,0.0018581239948416916,-0.03524237079986065,0.06781856918011017,-0.014704527736788866,0.03721486917452307,-0.03477838779674412,-0.039049978414020844,0.012625649244611558,-0.0019040665581508867,-0.04150965556078518,-0.033304134895664146,0.0670032320810418,0.0469576828572395,-0.0010425369421291273,-0.04290063626931812,0.026720879212637758,-0.015917106787346157,0.006596410663164891,-0.008624106403641217,0.008448950849491318,-0.01258093421491921,-0.06476506572307511,-0.0619236408567521,0.1102212637096135,0.18095377668846202,0.15107166088095994,0.060014715245552096,0.05171818993328436,0.030232085171987545,-0.10133640537270688,-0.13283266657993076,0.01744198037462832,-0.017260177505376496,-0.03500200166755656,0.06897201540547881,0.04022945358043128,-0.08564073500087921,0.012703050590653952,-0.05593026333043136,-0.03627259874695422

"Requests Journal During document selection, the program searches the system for FI documents, which match the selection criteria you have entered. This procedure means that not all FI documents belonging to a request are listed. Since the activities display, release, post, and print always relate to a request document, the request documents in these cases are processed together with all of the corresponding FI documents. This is also the case when FI documents belong to the request but were not included in the original selection. FI document numbers as well as the corresponding request numbers (lot numbers) are listed in the list output. The list output is based on the ABAP list viewer (ALV). This tool allows you to adjust the list output according to your requirements. The Display Variant is especially useful for this as it can be used to include new fields or delete existing fields. The display variant can be stored as of Release 4.01a. For more detailed information on the functions of the ALV, see ABAP List Viewer. You can use this function to select documents from specific requests, which share common criteria that you have defined. If you have called the request journal using a request maintenance transaction (for example, Release Acceptance Request), you can select and process documents from the list displayed. unknown Information System Requests Journal",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,Other,Other,Information System,,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,,Other,0.027390622620578568,0.16669715336518562,0.020680434739999448,-0.08642125773503641,-0.04791689904978661,-0.0488222622124577,0.08589258550579008,0.08447744411369339,-0.06319297307361688,-0.05708519309447582,0.024667367025242064,0.030717425308745158,-0.015574760974567378,0.07866039609337466,0.03911295201490381,-0.0027865266569365565,0.05455396777321457,0.019549623780196042,0.015104531008191787,0.04007163199653848,0.06724132275548304,0.02046565377171167,0.015825967712182736,-0.02589784473313482,0.02375307498047079,0.017020926764234248,-0.002874391344382017,0.04343024444650738,-0.12806616396164824,0.009119586658843092,-0.07657237775820676,0.004744991738172589,0.007244381710654754,-0.04841165555359495,-0.02444965626227386,0.05265452794232712,-0.0956549905548844,-0.11033004867817718,0.05316570575755201,0.10690090227088077,-0.004449029221031754,-0.037046131355485346,-0.1966511303236728,0.07949478868134092,0.02198897490885755,-0.23729228905459826,0.0679656637293093,-0.16774808624772186,-0.05560808055939768,-0.05791494809513789
"Inventory KPI Analysis Stock Changes Displays the stock value changes of the filtered materials with the current value in the company code currency for time periods. Consumption Changes Displays the consumption changes of the materials in the company code currency for time periods. The consumption value is the result of the consumption multiplied by the current price. Inventory Aging Changes Inventory Aging Changes Calculation The inventory aging changes are defined as a percentage relationship between average stock quantity and consumption quantity in the selected time period. Average Stock Over Time Period Calculation For this KPI, note that inventory aging includes only goods issued with movement types, which are marked as consumption. Reversal postings are not considered. Inventory Turnover Changes Inventory Turnover Changes Calculation The inventory turnover changes are defined as a relationship between consumption quantity and average stock quantity in the selected time period (quarters, months, days). An inventory turnover determines how often the average material was destocked and restocked in a specific time frame. A high inventory turnover indicates that materials are not in storage for a long time and that storage costs are low. With this KPI, warehouse managers receive important information about special materials or material groups. Range of Coverage Changes Range of Coverage Changes Calculation The range of coverage changes are defined as a relationship between current stock quantity and the relationship between consumption and number of days in the selected time period. Average Consumption As a result you get the range of coverage in days. The range of coverage provides information at stock level in relation to demand. It informs you how long a stock amount will last given a specific average daily requirement. In addition, the app supports the following technical features and options: You can use SAP CoPilot in this app. This digital assistant in the SAP S/4HANA system supports you with features like business context awareness or quick actions to manage follow-on activities directly from the app. You can send a link of selected search results by e-mail. To start a conversation and to share your comments on the selected search result, use chat in Microsoft Teams or Send Email. With this app, you can monitor inventory key performance indicators (KPIs) effectively to ensure forecast and inventory accuracy in a timely manner and visualize this in a meaningful way. This app supports you, for example, as an inventory analyst in your daily work. You can identify critical KPIs to monitor the inventory flow or investigate potential problems. You can check, for example, stock values as a time series for comparable periods in order to identify potential outliers that could affect the fixed capital situation. Furthermore, you can filter for these outliers and display only these particular stocks. Outliers can be identified as major changes at stock identifier level of a certain KPI in compared time periods. The app offers various KPI filters that display potential outliers in a frequency distribution chart. Inventory Manager : Manages inventory with respect to quantity and value.

"Assign Costing Keys to Characteristics - Profitability Analysis To calculate the cost of sales, you define rules in CO-PA Customizing and then use these rules to call up one or more specific material cost estimates in Product Cost Planning. To tailor contribution margin accounting to your needs, you can trace and display different requirements, such as the following examples: You wish to call up the standard cost estimate that has been released for material valuation and to calculate the costs of sales that have been reconciled with Financial Accounting (FI) for the goods issue key date.In additional rows of your contribution margin report, you wish to calculate the contribution margins for group production costs and then value sold products accordingly using group costing.As a make-to-order manufacturer, you wish to draw on the sales order costing results stored in the sales order to calculate the cost of sales.To display the most reliable early-warning information about the expected result, you wish to value your incoming sales orders using future or current costing.For planning purposes, you should use a search strategy to check several cost estimates individually and then incorporate them into valuation. Procedure for Valuation using Material Cost Estimates The valuation rules described above are stored in Customizing for CO-PA and are defined by the combination of the costing key and the assignment of the costing key to characteristics. How all this is related is depicted in the following graphic: When a sales order or a billing document is posted, the system first checks whether valuation using material cost estimates is active. The type of costing that is to be used to calculate the cost of sales is specified in a costing key. Costing keys can be assigned to different characteristic values. The cost components for cost of goods manufactured from Product Cost Planning are assigned to value fields in CO-PA. Costing Key You use the costing key to define the rules specifying which cost estimates from Product Cost Planning should be used to value the cost of sales in CO-PA. Flexible assignment means that you can assign the desired cost estimates based on the product or material type, or based on any other characteristic in your operating concern. In the costing key, you define the callup parameters required for cost determination. The following includes an example demonstrating the valuation logic: You use the costing variant and the costing version to tell the system to access for valuation the standard cost estimate in a particular version.As the validity date for the cost estimate, choose the planning period indicator Released standard cost estimate matching goods issue date to reconcile the cost of goods manufactured in CO-PA with those in FI.Since the delivering plant comes under the organization of a marketing company, you do not wish to read from this plant's cost estimate in order to calculate the costs of goods manufactured. Instead, you wish to read from the production plant. You specify the desired plant in the costing key.Alongside the main cost component split, you also copy the auxiliary cost component split. In this way, both the primary cost component split and the cost component split for cost of goods manufactured can be used for analyses in CO-PA. There are two basic ways to calculate the cost of sales in Profitability Analysis (CO-PA). While a retail company only needs to know the total value of goods as cost of sales, a much more detailed breakdown of the costs of goods manufactured is required in a manufacturing company. The costs are represented in the cost component split for the cost of goods manufactured, which divides material values into fixed and variable cost components for the cost of goods manufactured (such as material costs, internal services, external services), which can then be entered into different rows during multi-leveled contribution margin accounting. Valuation with cost estimates therefore values in CO-PA the quantities of products sold together with the costing results (such as the standard cost estimate) that were calculated in Product Cost Planning (CO-PC). See also the section Costing Sequence. For valuation using cost estimates, you can also define an access key to the Actual Costing/Material Ledger in order to use the actual cost estimate to value your sales quantities during periodic revaluation (see Setting Up Valuation Using Actual Cost Estimates from Material L). Note As an alternative to valuation using material cost estimates, it is possible in retail companies to calculate the value of goods using a condition from the material master or the goods issue document. For more detailed information, see the section Valuation Using Conditions or choose Master Data&nbsp;&nbsp;Valuation and then in Customizing for CO-PA. unknown Profitability Analysis Profitability Analysis Assign Costing Keys to Characteristics - Profitability Analysis",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,Other,Other,Other,,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,Profitability Analysis,Other,0.03256100333910471,0.15329390461759682,0.09571255276064476,-0.15818586258963216,-0.048194011677473426,-0.07353898870976107,-0.03054326429293843,0.023932235347713424,-0.07079850082066996,0.28154452945271013,-0.0969165495376017,0.0003800386011198603,-0.17755854089827405,-0.08815319719898126,-0.01065293292651581,-0.00709070866618502,0.06568795026944109,-0.011328945752363716,-0.005288071582467253,0.01073962376219157,-0.016612954344756393,-0.22091231831518784,-0.06803677969750846,0.1192167181234713,-0.07412179281672722,0.032463668268348025,0.008147893147785856,-0.027853552915600845,0.025904301371354407,0.012278180520839545,-0.08975370109635165,0.10906217794767242,0.021765248812315365,-0.01894940513063004,0.01708399419451677,0.05302849945920229,-0.03071132185179354,0.10166211913800222,0.06966581794956121,-0.09559912293610472,-0.021703150875601714,0.12205918387472559,0.01564060562250955,0.14326898391147727,0.050199113699773736,-0.14600845087089104,0.0960038404261748,-0.010740459786965504,0.07908903024212137,0.050195456636517956

"Manage Maintenance Notifications and Orders, Manage Work Requests and Orders This app allows you to do the following: View maintenance notifications that have been screened and accepted following this process: A maintenance request is created for a technical object. For more information, see Create Maintenance Request. The new maintenance request is available for screening and acceptance. For more information, see Screen Maintenance Requests. The accepted maintenance request is available in this app for processing. Filter maintenance notifications and orders. You can, for example, filter the list by execution object type to display only maintenance notifications or maintenance orders, or filter the maintenance notifications and orders by their priority or subphase, by their account assignment details, or by the cost receivers that have been specified in a settlement rule. The system only displays maintenance orders and notifications that are processed by phases. Group and sort maintenance notifications or maintenance orders. View details of a maintenance notification such as priority, failure mode, final due date, associated orders, and so on. View details of a maintenance order such as priority, final due date, associated notifications, and so on. Create a maintenance order for a single maintenance notification. When you create an order for a notification, the notification becomes the header notification of the order. The order inherits details from the notification. The new maintenance order has a unique order number. You can create an order for a notification only if the notification has not already been assigned to an order. Select multiple maintenance notifications and create one or more maintenance orders. Create a single maintenance order for the notifications you have selected and assign one of the notifications as the header notification. This notification will be displayed in the overview. To view other notifications associated with the maintenance order, choose More. Create multiple maintenance orders for the maintenance notifications you have selected. A separate order will be created for each of the notifications. Assign an existing order to one or more notifications. If you receive a notification for an object and a problem for which an order has already been created, then you don't have to create a new order. You can assign the existing order to the notification. Unassign an order from a notification. You can only unassign an order from a notification that is not the header notification. You can change the header notification in the Change Maintenance Order app. Select one or more maintenance orders and mass-edit several attributes by means of a quick action. For example, you can edit the location data, responsibilities, or the cost receivers that are maintained in a settlement rule. You can run a simulation to test the data, or apply the mass change directly in the system. You can view the details of the simulated or scheduled job in the Application Logs. For more information, see Mass Editing of Maintenance Orders. Submit one or more orders for approval. Some orders require an approval based on order attributes and cost. In this case, the maintenance planner has to submit the order for approval before it can be released to the Preparation phase. Whether or not an approval is required depends on the approval settings that have been defined for a combination of maintenance order type and planning plant in Customizing under Define Approval Settings for Maintenance Orders. Note The approvers for an order can be determined by means of workflow rules. Depending on the configured workflows, the defined approvers will see the submitted orders in the My Inbox app, where they can approve or reject them. For more information, see Manage Workflows for Maintenance Orders and Manage Teams and Responsibilities. Change the responsibility for one or more maintenance notifications and maintenance orders. For each attribute, you can keep the existing values, select new values, or leave the field blank. You can't change the responsibility for orders that have been submitted for approval. Select one or more maintenance orders and change the order status. You can, for example, release the selected orders, complete them from a technical and business perspective, block further processing, or mark orders for deletion. You can also cancel certain order statuses. Select one or more maintenance notifications and change the notification status. You can complete the selected notifications, mark them for deletion, or remove the deletion flag. Navigate to related apps from the object page. Generate output items using the Determine Output Items quick action button on the notification object page. If output items aren't yet available for a maintenance request, pressing the quick action button populates the output items table. If output items have already been generated, pressing the button again redetermines the output items depending on the parameters or status of the request. Once the output is sent, it moves to the status To be Output and then to Completed when it is finally done. You can see the output preview from the icon in the Display column. For output items where the Dispatch Time is maintained as Scheduled, the application job, which runs in the background, picks and sends the output to the queue. Note The following prerequisite must be fulfilled to determine the output: Set up SAP S/4HANA Output Control. For more information, see Setup of SAP S/4HANA Output Control With this app, you can manage maintenance notifications and maintenance orders that are processed by phases. Note This app has been designed to be used within the functional scope of the Reactive Maintenance (4HH) and Proactive Maintenance (4HI) scope items that differs from how the maintenance process had been run before (based on the scope items BH1, BH2 and BJ2). Some of the features might not work in the same way or they might not work at all. Furthermore, not all the features of this Fiori app are available for maintenance orders of order types for which the phase model has not been activated.

"Payment Order Lot (Real-Time) After the items are selected and the payment amount is assigned to the items, the system either creates a payment order or posts a payment document. The system makes this decision based on the characteristics of the selected payment method. To create payment orders, set the Payment order only indicator on the payment method. Caution For payment by credit card, it is not possible to create a payment order. The payment method can either be specified from outside by the Web service, or the default is determined from the Define Default Payment Methods Customizing activity. There you specify the default payment method for virtual accounts (bank accounts only) using the type of payment processing Real-Time Payment Using Virtual Bank Account. Using additional entries for the type of payment processing Real-Time Payment, you can specify default payment methods for bank and card payment methods for the scenarios mentioned above that are not handled using virtual accounts. In events 6021 and 6230, you can check the existence of appropriate payment methods at the level of items, contract accounts, or contracts. If a declaration of consent is required for real-time payments, you can also check the existence of one in these events. If a payment order is created, the system records the data from the external cash desk in the payment order, so that it can be displayed there. This ensures that you can navigate from the payment order back to the real-time payment. The data from the external cash desk is displayed on a separate tab in the detailed display of the payment order. unknown Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable Payment Order Lot (Real-Time)",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,,Other,Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable,,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,,Other,0.03299179261889301,0.21251818915772555,-0.04429775035233287,0.008637841575336546,-0.045018231676642644,0.01939629864903865,0.07063440093834385,0.027096262329007473,-0.019984667126925013,-0.01924672174478755,-0.040048243556878506,0.05250104981674449,0.04991048160795097,0.05102418875601343,0.14375907121410297,0.03741790616904682,-0.09887678334876927,0.10129421576231765,-0.04573568036539233,-0.04297830531479414,-0.06750931378969445,-0.058338351493108585,-0.04646782850113377,0.04724742667980875,-0.02427679436191024,0.15639756346976036,0.06752015422586592,-0.09088058457089718,-0.042277720531358726,-0.13911539401053052,-0.07553667346179233,-0.014394905767763842,-0.13168161732889838,0.35582924272536465,0.026606306924054836,-0.2006202574127008,0.0611623931738857,0.06315533719995943,-0.1638537878502775,0.011804687111765246,0.31903986695661324,0.05137277440329207,-0.10532519561838219,-0.06321791342743198,-0.060752428139790045,-0.13270831215189374,0.12166465098163703,0.004956487778749193,0.006004866463747392,-0.05528495409621795

"Create PI Documents - Cycle Counting Cycle counting is a method of physical inventory whereby inventory is counted at regular intervals within a fiscal year. These intervals depend on the cycle counting indicator set for the material. Cycle Counting allows you to count fast-moving items more frequently than slow-moving items, for example. General Procedure Mark all materials that are to be included in cycle counting with a cycle counting indicator in the material master record (storage data). The cycle counting indicator is used to group the materials together into various cycle counting categories (for example, A , B , C, and D). In Customizing for Inventory Management, you can define for each category the time intervals at which the materials are to be counted. You can use the program ABC Cycle Counting Analysis ( RMCBIN00) to perform an analysis. In this analysis, the system assigns the materials to the individual categories according to consumption or requirements. You can also specify whether this analysis is to consider only the materials with cycle counting indicator or all materials. The cycle counting indicator in the material master records can be updated automatically by this program. For the planning of cycle counting, run the program Create physical inventory documents for cycle counting ( RM07ICN1 ). This program checks all cycle counting materials to determine whether a physical inventory is due to be carried out. Note For more information on programs used for cycle counting, see the relevant report documentation. You can create physical inventory documents for the following stock types, as well as unrestricted-use stock (stock type 1): quality inspection stock blocked stock The system calculates the planned count date for all stock types as folllows: Date of last physical inventory of unrestricted-use stock + predefined interval If a material needs to be counted, use the program to create a batch input session for creating physical inventory documents. To create the physical inventory documents, process the batch input session . When the inventory differences are posted, the actual count date is recorded in the physical inventory data of the material as the date of the last physical inventory. unknown Inventory Management Cycle Counting Create PI Documents - Cycle Counting",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,,Other,Inventory Management,,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,Other,Other,0.017979500392019673,0.09825272664300976,0.0480622337890915,-0.10896687222346292,-0.05810778874974964,-0.12344421239239571,0.03736986542106067,0.11192073173872784,0.2970451649933662,0.016694407108192044,-0.049340974425583085,-0.06321906719496917,-0.13388454504120753,-0.012082979094417383,-0.0547925937706717,-0.018779662987474372,0.061343092501322395,0.04445404601771829,-0.06895090275795007,0.05146508639756992,0.03370167973041541,0.09785790459206245,0.016642942948363527,0.030256992183258037,0.011661673103109503,0.04566342125921103,-0.11633127898972356,-0.03204488885395136,-0.019334886209687447,0.026135742104816843,-0.13212112966101336,0.06555128139555913,-0.07574939415307065,0.038387208540608654,-0.045294865965981715,0.007288453087589335,0.031677756371717485,-0.0780641879593493,0.0625524220583069,-0.053020638026891456,0.029902342076509682,-0.06321505182871062,-0.030042084577568216,-0.11619517168671664,0.009314284248990947,0.05290752090186553,0.02859499250337107,0.0035871535416038144,-0.007148234125829513,0.06649957469834994

Payroll clearing accounts. (See the Personnel Administration and Payroll documentation in the SAP Library for more information on these accounts.) All items involved in clearing are assigned a clearing document number and a clearing date.

"Display Inspection Plan Changes Change Rule In the header data of the inspection plan, you use the change rule to define the approval procedure for an inspection plan: Without change numberIf you do not specify a change rule, you can change inspection plans with and without change numbers. You do not have to specify a change number. With change numberWhen you call up the inspection plan, you must enter a change number with the change master (LO-ECH). With change record (without change record type)When you call up the inspection plan, you must enter a change number that was generated from a change record. However, the change record type is not transferred. You can make changes with change numbers of different change record types. With change record (with change record type)In this case, the change record type is taken from the specified change number. All further changes to the inspection plan are only possible with change numbers of the same change record type. Maintaining a Revision Level for an Inspection PlanIf your company maintains several versions of a material that are only distinguished by revision levels, you can create and edit corresponding inspection plan variants for these materials. In this way, the system can automatically select the appropriate inspection plan for an inspection, whenever such a material is subject to a goods receipt inspection. You have various options for changing inspection plans: Changing without a change number Changing with a change number via the change masterThe changes are documented via the change master and the key date from which the changes are valid is specified. Changing with a change number using a change recordChange records allow you to manage changes in a regulated environment. All changes are subject to approval. Note Inspection plan changes are not copied to existing inspection lots. Note You can use change numbers when you create inspection plans.

"Print Production Versions The consistency check determines a check status for the objects assigned (task list/recipe or BOM). All change statuses within the validity period of the production version are taken into account. Warning and error messages about inconsistencies are displayed in the check result. The check status for each object is displayed as an icon in the production version. The following icons may be displayed: Check Status Meaning Possible Reasons Error The object does not continuously exist throughout the entire validity period of the production version. The lot-size range of the object does not comprise the entire lot-size range of the production version. Warning No check was carried out for the object. The deletion flag is set for the object. The header material of the production version is not assigned to the task list/recipe. O.K. None of the above inconsistencies occurred. At the production version level, the check status is summarized as follows: If no task list/master recipe or alternative BOM is assigned to the production version, the yellow traffic-light is displayed. Otherwise, the check status of the object with the worst check result is displayed. A red traffic-light is, for example, displayed whenever a red traffic-light exists at the object level. You use this function to check whether the data of a production version is consistent with the data of the assigned task lists/master recipes and the assigned alternative BOM. In this way, you make sure that a valid task list or valid BOM really exists for the entire validity period of the production version. unknown Basic Data Print Production Versions",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,Other,Other,Other,,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,,Other,0.0192542743613403,0.10648099456092283,0.08053079925664164,-0.11337859157165303,-0.07139620853650419,0.10189446604907336,-0.053487166495168624,0.007376358689308825,-0.017210910811395624,0.0019473992557208638,0.04762297227685221,-0.016218168036044527,-0.04407641723864643,0.05577487013701499,0.027839855025393427,0.015148175213260631,0.024667771361306164,0.02747476297482204,0.031022799022150084,0.013655438970521147,0.01430909744953234,-0.031226408798371727,-0.002571142279007763,-0.03143557206984896,0.028126750456575512,-0.020692188715865957,-0.035096181953619694,0.0327829845414024,-0.038897966036601325,-0.01895141296559308,-0.03738413609379064,-0.018655861770449436,0.014086958589222019,-0.001165169209276721,-0.013698003996076194,0.0014510070708553377,-0.03887907584783586,-0.00961494682727663,-0.02024929342198031,0.04585590580295561,0.040026235539814485,0.0647910971067686,-0.0503154305286819,-0.10316728586225629,0.22425787154921967,0.07107985533668428,0.11144327086293984,-0.10727876693053959,0.013519905620547145,0.05277387121671338

"Run Compliance Reports - Singapore AA Reporting Managing Fraction Digits You can modify the currency fields in you report and control the number of decimals displayed during report generation using the field Number of Decimals for Currency Amounts. The default number of decimals are taken from the data source initially, which can later be modified as required. Based on the adjustment done, during preview, the values are validated against the data already given during preview. The ability to customize fraction digits are enabled only for CDS, ABAP Dictionary, or query-based documents. Enabling Schema changes You can now easily view the selected CDS fields during schema creation in the CDS Field Selection dialog. Additionally, you can view the selected fields while editing the schema as well. Enabling Activity Group for activities You can categorize similar reporting activities into a single group based on their functions. Assigning reporting activities into groups help when you want to perform some additional actions, such as identifying a specific reporting activity based on the group they are allotted to. The activity group value assigned to the reporting activity group will be available in the Run Compliance Reports app and based on this value, appropriate business checks can be processed. New Organizational Units Two new organizational units Profit Center and Segment are introduced in SAP S/4HANA Cloud. These new options can be used as a replacement for Business Area while defining report category. New statuses for documents The Document Status column is enhanced with two new statuses such as In Process (Editing) and In Process (Regeneration). In Process (Editing) status appears when the document is saved with manual changes and In Process (Regeneration) status appears when the document is being regenerated.

"Change Billing Documents Change billing document details such as the billing date, texts, pricing, and output items Note Depending on the timing, you can make only limited changes. Before the system has forwarded the billing document to financial accounting, you can do the following: Change the billing date (in the header details), texts, and output items. This includes the option to trigger a redetermination of output items, which adds the new output items underneath the existing ones. Carry out new pricing for individual items or change the prices manually After the system forwards the billing document to financial accounting, you can only change output items and texts. If you need to make other changes, you will have to cancel the billing document and create a new one. Search for billing documents by document number, company code, fiscal year, or reference Cancel the billing document that you are currently viewing When you cancel a billing document, the system creates a billing document cancellation (for example, an invoice cancellation), which copies data from the billing document and creates an offsetting entry in financial accounting when it is posted. The cancellation causes the preceding billable document (for example, the delivery) to be open for billing again, so that you can then create the correct billing document.Note If the system has already posted the now-canceled billing document to financial accounting, it has also automatically posted the corresponding cancellation billing document to offset the canceled document's entry. If the system has not yet posted the canceled billing document to financial accounting, both the canceled billing document and the cancellation billing document receive posting status E (billing document canceled). In this case, posting is not necessary and no journal entries are created. Display the document's output items and perform actions such as send, add, and duplicate output, and more. You can also display a PDF preview of the output, which shows what the billing document will look like when it's printed or converted to PDF format. Note The values of some tax fields may not be finalized until the billing document has been posted to financial accounting. Therefore, there are sometimes small numeric discrepancies between tax field values in the output preview (which is generated before posting) and the final output (which is generated after posting). This can be due to financial accounting applying a different currency exchange rate than was used at the time of billing document creation.In some cases, a value may not be calculated at all until the billing document has been posted, and will therefore be missing in the preview.In case of doubt, the values in the final output are correct and the values in the preview should be disregarded. Navigate to an overview of associated accounting documents Navigate to the document flow and the pricing conditions for the headerTip The document flow in the Display Billing Documents and Change Billing Documents apps exposes the entire related document chain, independent of business role.In contrast, the process flow in the Manage Billing Documents app and the Billing Document object page offers a simplified representation of the document chain that focuses on documents that are central to the responsibilities of the billing clerk. Therefore, you may see documents in a billing document's document flow that you cannot see in that same billing document's process flow. App ID: VF02 With this app, you can change some attributes of billing documents such as invoices, credit memos, and so on.

"Resource-Related Billing Between Company Codes In the service branch it is common that employees belonging to one company code sometimes work for other company codes. Often one company code (the requesting company code such as a particular international subsidiary) of an enterprise carries out a project in conjunction with external customers, and uses employees from other company codes (the supplying company codes).

"Enter and Post PI Count with Document This process consists of two parts: You create a session for the objects in question. The session is “processed”. The system now performs the operation for every object. In physical inventory, work with sessions is supported for the following functions: Creating a physical inventory document (see Creating Physical Inventory Documents) Blocking a material (see Blocking Materials for Postings) Entering the count or transferring PDC count data (*) Freezing the book inventory (see Freezing the Book Inventory) Setting a zero count automatically (see Setting Zero Count) Posting differences (see Posting Differences) Posting the count and differences (*) Posting the physical inventory document, the count, and the differences (*) The functions marked with an asterisk (*) cannot be carried out by the SAP System alone, since the system does not know the counting results. These functions are used to transfer physical inventory data into the SAP System if the count was carried out with another system. If you want to carry out a transaction for many objects (for example, create physical inventory documents for many materials), the SAP System can automatically execute it according to your specifications. One advantage of this procedure is that you save monotonous entry time. Another is that a session can be processed at various times, allowing your system administrator to better utilize the capacities of the computer. unknown Inventory Management Enter and Post PI Count with Document",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,Other,Other,Inventory Management,,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,,Other,0.05004513612505167,0.10299665956705052,0.04128243876985481,-0.11331606134095572,-0.06646356612696482,-0.1448871840256311,0.06337411331106754,0.10720275315629291,0.3612628420756962,-0.008499553079365264,-0.06056780290474706,-0.0714880277441594,-0.12281559429906554,-0.01615517949746077,-0.051175816398276903,0.011134934384412012,0.10207915466696704,0.051706794309015716,-0.09086213262608861,0.07599340166745931,0.06744656464723822,0.1224508916040733,0.040682219622484056,0.02627815606825099,-0.00831493081934275,0.04350057894131283,-0.11852189078487621,-0.0363528865219654,-0.044976735219335,0.023559715254465343,-0.15235414287674087,0.05595490999347913,-0.09108167493344936,0.03630824720966748,-0.05856245972470592,0.023344478834904786,0.0812162303308614,-0.11574284963382422,0.03778843082641263,-0.06768772012976508,-0.014715887836635924,-0.07039877327688325,-0.0310762414569374,-0.07910532994207058,-0.024224407188680845,0.03777614141581581,0.06437332599265026,-0.017613136623026524,0.009795480372182626,0.032055669902198776

"Analyze Cost Element Itemization - Grouped You can use itemizations to analyze costed materials or sales document items in more detail.An itemization is generated automatically with a cost estimate.Note If you want to see the itemization in the cost estimate and in the information system, you need to select the Itemization indicator when saving the cost estimate.An itemization is generated dynamically during preliminary costing for a production order or production campaign. However, this itemization is not stored and therefore cannot be analyzed in the information system. The itemization is available for analysis immediately after you carry out costing. Layouts Different layouts of the itemization are available to answer different questions. The costs can be broken down by cost element, operation, or costing item. The following layouts are described in more detail: Itemization by Costing Item Itemization by Cost Component / Cost Element Itemization by Operation Itemization by Cost Element Note You can create your own layouts to be able to see other information in the itemization. For example, you can add the purchasing info record and the purchasing organization or the origin groups to the report display, or add the text of the activity types or item categories. Origin Groups Origin groups provide more detailed information on the source of the material costs or on the origin of the overhead. With material costs, the origin group is entered in the material master record. With overhead costs, the origin group is entered in the credit key of the costing sheet. Cost Elements In the itemization, you can also see the costs broken down into cost elements. Material costs, external activities, and non-stock materials are assigned to primary cost elements. In this itemization they are shown under cost elements determined by the system. Costs for internal activities are displayed under the allocation cost element of the activity type that was entered in the master record of the activity type. Overhead costs and process costs are also displayed under secondary cost elements. Because all actual costs are also assigned to these cost elements, a plan/actual comparison is possible later. unknown Information System Grouped Analyze Cost Element Itemization - Grouped",1,1,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,,Other,Information System,,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,Other,Other,0.022136053382920993,0.11666342050467467,0.060577332962914635,-0.10855913480980678,-0.07259202643714574,-0.052283340389563976,-0.056258547568192444,0.04678779424398611,-0.06896200604200044,0.2228859583926064,-0.031467209692011076,-0.012822466966237045,-0.11886103334988767,-0.04995145502678842,-0.03214087122096213,-0.030196786381410025,0.037341884026135724,0.04581619435027488,0.029891749205372478,0.040241000225216865,-0.03795784769730581,-0.0861079304344093,-0.08104204047383227,0.1106517210751155,-0.03835757504381767,0.013897536262699893,0.009913775276179917,-0.025630901114662045,0.003047518201560532,0.023934313890831935,-0.04278282479759687,0.018472501885729183,0.026067892211732207,-0.000964162806890908,0.01358336511289276,-0.01207396082956036,-0.022953687938359238,0.013685653860370394,0.01271984755624505,-0.03520517047610817,-0.030041655474074086,0.08733106352160196,-0.00834165303870139,0.047879120857159584,0.06725615632920635,-0.07074704631486516,0.022145266882233332,-0.04016487886760289,0.14072273204630742,-0.006769789871799339
"Create Asset Master Record - For Legacy Asset Steps with the Manual Transfer of Legacy Data The manual legacy data transfer includes the following steps: Create the asset master records for the legacy data transfer.Customizing activity: Asset Accounting&nbsp;&nbsp;Asset Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Manual Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Legacy Fixed Asset&nbsp;&nbsp;Create Master Data for Legacy Asset (transaction AS91) Post the transfer values.Customizing activity: Asset Accounting&nbsp;&nbsp;Asset Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Manual Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Legacy Fixed Asset&nbsp;&nbsp;Post Transfer Values (transaction ABLDT)A journal entry is posted for the asset with this. The G/L accounts are also updated. For each asset a transfer document is created that posts the transfer values, for example, on the APC and accumulated depreciation account and against the offsetting account for the legacy data transfer. With a data transfer during the year, you transfer asset-related business transactions that occurred before the transfer date in the current fiscal year (transfer using transaction AB01L).If a posting date in the current fiscal year is entered that is before the transfer date, the system recognizes this business transaction as a transfer document; no depreciation is calculated, the document is posted against the offsetting account for the legacy data transfer. For assets under construction that are line item-managed, transfer the open items.Customizing activity: Asset Accounting&nbsp;&nbsp;Asset Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Manual Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Legacy Fixed Asset&nbsp;&nbsp;AUC with Line Item Management: Transfer Line Items, transaction ABLDT_OI) More Functions with the Manual Legacy Data Transfer You can also use the following functions with the manual legacy data transfer: You can display the master data.Customizing activity: Asset Accounting&nbsp;&nbsp;Asset Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Manual Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Legacy Fixed Asset&nbsp;&nbsp;Create Master Data for Legacy Asset (transaction AS93) You can modify the master data.Customizing activity: Asset Accounting&nbsp;&nbsp;Asset Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Manual Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Legacy Fixed Asset&nbsp;&nbsp;Display Master Data for Legacy Asset (transaction AS92) You can create subnumbers for the asset master record.Customizing activity: Asset Accounting&nbsp;&nbsp;Asset Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Manual Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Legacy Fixed Asset&nbsp;&nbsp;Create Master Data for Subnumber for Legacy Asset (transaction AS94) Master Data You create master data for legacy assets exactly the same way as you create regular asset master data. However, take into account the following special features of legacy assets: The capitalization date is always a required entry. Using the capitalization date, the system determines the depreciation start date and the expired useful life, based on the period control in the depreciation key.If the asset was acquired at a time when the company code had a different fiscal year variant, this determination of the useful life will be correct only if the period calendar assignments have been maintained historically. The planned useful life is a required entry when a depreciation key for automatic depreciation calculation has been entered.You can also account for increased wear and tear on an asset in the past as the result of multiple shift use. You do this by manually correcting the expired useful life that was automatically calculated by the system. Time-dependent data (such as the assignment to a cost center) can only be transferred with the values current on the transfer date. To create new time intervals, you have to use the function for changing master data. Post Asset Values (Transfer Values). Take into account the following special features when transferring legacy asset values: Depreciation areas:You must take all active depreciation areas for the asset into account, and enter the historical acquisition costs. Posted depreciation (for a transfer during the year)If you transfer legacy data during the fiscal year, you can enter the depreciation that was already posted in the legacy system in the current fiscal year.Specify the last depreciation period posted (in the legacy system) (field FAA_DEPR_PERIOD) when entering the depreciation posted in the transfer year. The system requires this information to determine the first period for the depreciation that should be posted in the SAP system.Manual depreciation first generates a statistical noted item in Asset Accounting and, depending on the posting indicator for the depreciation area, is posted to the FI accounts with the following depreciation run. Make sure then that, for a transfer during the year of depreciation posted manually (for example, with transaction type 640), the respective amount (depending on the posting indicator and on whether postings to FI accounts took place in the legacy system or not) has to be a partial amount of the posted depreciation transferred during the year (transaction type 500). Transactions (for a transfer during the fiscal year)With a legacy data transfer during the fiscal year, the transfer date of the given company code is not the end of the fiscal year (see Transfer During the Year). You can transfer the transactions from the current fiscal year up to the date of the transfer for legacy data transfer during the fiscal year.Make the following entries when transferring transactions:Asset value dateNote that the asset value date has to be in the current fiscal year, and it must lie before the transfer date. Transaction type Posting Amount Posted revaluations:Posted revaluations are first entered in Asset Accounting as statistical items and are only then transferred (posted) to the FI accounts with the next depreciation run. Depending on the Customizing settings for the depreciation area, it is therefore necessary to specify the revaluations within the framework of the depreciation posted during the year as both a statistical line item as well as a “posted value”. The values you enter are also checked against the positive/negative sign rules of the depreciation area (positive/negative net book value, positive/negative ordinary depreciation, and so on). Change Transfer Values Subsequently If wrong transfer values were posted, you must reverse the journal entry and then enter the transfer values again. You can only change transfer values by reversing the posted transfer document and making a new posting. To be able to reverse a transfer document, subsequent transactions are not allowed to exist on the fixed asset. If follow-on transactions were already posted on the fixed asset, we recommend you proceed as follows: Reverse all transactions in reverse chronological order. Reverse the transfer transaction. Post the new transfer values. Enter the follow-on transactions again individually. Depreciation Areas in Foreign Currencies With the manual data transfer, you must transfer the historical values from the feeder system. The foreign currency amounts cannot be determined using an exchange rate by a specified key date. The system therefore does not support historical currency translations; in fact you must enter the values. Note The settings defined in Customizing activity Asset Accounting&nbsp;&nbsp;Asset Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Parameters for Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer Foreign Currency Areas (transaction OAYD) only affect automatic transfers; they have no effect on manual data transfers (transaction ABLDT). Line Item-Managed Assets under Construction (AuC) To ensure that the line item-managed assets under construction are included, the transfer values are not allowed to be entered as accumulated values in Customizing activity Asset Accounting&nbsp;&nbsp;Asset Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Manual Data Transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;Legacy Fixed Asset&nbsp;&nbsp;Post Transfer Values (transaction ABLDT). You must enter the values individually instead using transaction ABLDT_OI. You must use the specific transaction types 900 and 910 for the transfer. If you have the special case of proportional depreciation on the AuC, then enter this as proportional depreciation from the previous years using the transaction. You can use this function to manually create legacy assets in the system.

"Generate Upload Request CC2 Download The Download function allows you to send data to the subsystem, so that input checks can be made. It is necessary to download data to the subsystem to be able to perform checks in the subsystem. At the level of the subsystem, for example, the following checks can be made:Existence checks for operations Quantity checks In the operations download, operation data is transferred to the subsystem. A distinction is made between the following transfer types: In the initial download, the operations from the production orders that meet the requirements mentioned above are transferred from the SAP system to the subsystem. In the delta download it is ensured that all operations that have been added since the last initial download are transferred to the subsystem. In the master data download, the master tables are downloaded to the subsystem, so that extensive checks can be made.

"Transfer Items During the transfer, the system clears the selected items and posts them to the target account. As much of the posting information as possible is transferred. The new items only differ from the original items in their origin and posting date. The receivables account, due date, transaction name, and dunning and interest information remain the same for these items. You maintain transactions for the transferred items in Customizing for Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable under Business Transactions&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers&nbsp;&nbsp;Define Transactions for Transferring Items. During the transfer, the system does not perform account determination again for the new items. However, this makes it easier to read the account balance display, since you can recognize the transferred items directly from the transaction and transaction text. In event 5110, you can define whether existing payment and dunning locks are retained. If the target account for the transfer posting is a contract account that belongs to a collective bill account, the collective bill is updated automatically. The following can be transferred: Individual items – receivables and credits (see also the explanations for transfer postings in Clarifying Credits) All items of a business partner All items of a contract account All items of a contract Items in an installment plan; The existing installment plan is automatically deactivated and a new installment plan is created in the amount of the still open original receivable. Items belonging to a collective bill; The collective bill is updated automatically. You can reverse the transfer document. For more information about transferring, see SAP Note 616098 . Transferring receivables or credits is necessary if a business partner assumes the rights and obligations of another business partner, such as in the case of inheritance or taking on liabilities. From time to time it might also be necessary to transfer receivables or credits within different contracts or contract accounts of the same business partner. This is the case, for example, if a customer terminates a contract, but the remaining receivables are to be collected together with the receivables for the new contract. unknown Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable Transfer Items",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,Other,Other,Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable,,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,,Other,0.045177635569189016,0.27699001380269583,-0.04638637647562427,-0.031650622398720255,-0.0677960505070619,-0.06100503674710558,0.028336880489283567,0.167604465676934,-0.07160367349295947,-0.03694411881767036,-0.0298469155128723,-0.062194713071651815,0.18138527921286313,0.10161404662276848,0.12876724364654132,0.03828078019988416,-0.07225517260573704,-0.10114854677132779,-0.08064504611951405,-0.021512857460886502,-0.025531111702168003,0.00491134015744125,-0.08142464992104616,0.025777048285743162,0.028110477155068907,0.039239523435152114,-0.0537905902004841,-0.026570394094641715,-0.05015710794869472,-0.050210306043824524,-0.07969039840027181,-0.10642815917916335,-0.057810687964921746,0.11511034137072329,0.25678488490551343,0.10040385885614476,0.012104090380941613,-0.02955154406936934,0.009130164310612728,-0.12447229203155143,-0.12640986215106392,0.0947685231938852,0.10158615509228125,-0.01799283789325666,0.03594301415979537,0.06641340833473802,-0.02950901789134313,0.04563406617275728,-0.07991440541763323,0.0003028040985885099

"Change Cmmt Item Substrings Group You can create, maintain, copy, and automatically generate substring groups. Substring Groups A substring group can include existing substring groups of this substring. This way you can divide a complex group of master data objects into segments that are self-explanatory and therefore easier to understand. To define substring groups, you can specify intervals for the values of the substrings. Provided that you have defined the selection of substring groups using an interval (for example, master data interval AA to ZZ), the new master data, for which this selection applies, is automatically assigned to the respective master data substring group. Note The substring groups for master data are year-independent. This means that if you create new master data in the following year, this master data will automatically belong to the substring group that it belonged to in the previous year. Automatic Generation of Substring Groups You can generate the substring groups automatically for each substring with a master data subdivision using transaction FMMD_SETGEN.Prerequisite for this is that you have defined a structure within a substring in Customizing. These groups can then be used in the reports of the Report Painter. For more information, see the system documentation for this transaction. You can create substring groups for a substring. This means that you can create your substrings in groups for the subdivision of master data. You use the following transactions for this: FM_CISUB_SET1, FM_CISUB_SET2, FM_CISUB_SET3 (substring groups for commitment item) FM_FCSUB_SET1, FM_FCSUB_SET2, FM_FCSUB_SET3 (substring groups for funds center) FM_FCSUB_SET1, FM_FCSUB_SET2, FM_FCSUB_SET3 (substring groups for fund) FM_FNSUB_SET1, FM_FNSUB_SET2, FM_FNSUB_SET3 (substring groups for functional area) You can use the substring groups for the selection of Report Writer reportsin Funds Management, provided that the reports are based on the data of the special ledger. You can also use substring groups in the component Controlling (CO) to execute evaluations of Report Writer reports and to select substring groups in CO transactions To do this, you subdivide the substrings of the account assignment elements (commitment item, funds center, fund, functional area) into groups according to specific subdivision criteria.

"Maintain Responsibilities for Department The dunning run automatically assigns the work items created to a department. On the SAP Easy Access screen under Periodic Processing&nbsp;&nbsp;For Contract Accounts&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunning&nbsp;&nbsp;By Collection Strategy&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibilities, you can define responsibilities for departments, work groups, or collection specialists (transaction FKKCLERK_CM_CUUNIT, FKKCLERK_CM_CUCENTER, and FKKCLERK_CM_CUAGENT). Using the Define Additional Department or Group Head transaction, you can create (external) employees, who are not assigned to a collection department in organizational management, as additional managers of a collections department or collections unit (transaction FPMANAGER). Using the Define Additional Collection Specialist transaction, you can create (external) employees, who are not assigned to a collection department in organizational management, as additional collections specialists (transaction FPAGENT). This means that when you create a work item, the system can assign a work group or specialist, in addition to the department. A department or group manager can change the automatic assignment of work groups and specialists manually (see Worklist). In Customizing for Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable under Business Transactions&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunning&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunning by Collection StrategyClerk Determination, you can also define replacement tasks for determining the collection specialist. To simulate the assignment of work items generated in the dunning run, on the SAP Easy Access screen, choose Periodic Processing&nbsp;&nbsp;For Contract Accounts&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunning&nbsp;&nbsp;By Collection Strategy&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibilities&nbsp;&nbsp;Simulate Responsibilities (transaction FKKCLERK_CM_CUDUNN). Here you can simulate the derivation of the three hierarchy levels in one step using data from dunning. This means that the test directly follows the flow of the dunning program (see SAP Easy Access screen: Periodic Processing&nbsp;&nbsp;For Contract Accounts&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunning&nbsp;&nbsp; Areas of Responsibility). To enable the work items created by the dunning run to be processed, the responsible clerks must be assigned.

"Approve Payment (Overview Mode) Before forwarding a payment to the Collections/Disbursements system, the system checks whether the processing clerk has sufficient authorization even to create a payment. The following conditions mean that another processing clerk must check a payment before it can be paid out: Authorization limit for each payment amount is exceeded Authorization amount for each compensation total of the relevant subclaim typeis exceeded Disbursement exceeds contractually agreed rules, such as limitsand deductibles A rejected payment is reactivated You can find more information under Release or Rejection of a Payment to Be Released . Selection by Random Generator . If one of the conditions named above is met, the system sets the status of the payment to To Be Released . The payment is not forwarded to the Collections/Disbursements system. Another claim handler with sufficient release authorization must check the payment and release or reject it. As payouts directly influence the economic results of a company, management often rules that the dual control principle must be applied. If a payment is selected for the dual control principle, this payment must be checked by another processing clerk. If this processing clerk regards the payment as correct, he or she releases this payment. Only then is the payment forwarded to the Collections/Disbursements system. If the processing clerk does not regard the payment as being correct, he or she rejects the payment. The processing clerk who created the payment must then delete or correct the payment.

"Set Subsequent Account Assignments You can enter the following account assignments in business partner items in the posting document in Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable: Business area Segment Profit center If you have not used one these account assignments up to now, but want to use it in the future, you can only do so in new documents. You cannot change any of these account assignments subsequently in documents that were already posted, since this would cause errors in the reconciliation with the general ledger. As a result, the account assignments are also missing in follow-on postings that arise due to clearing or other follow-on processes (such as cash discounts, payment surcharges, interest, exchange rate differences, or down payments on statistical request) for these documents. For key date evaluations of open items, balances without account assignment remain until the last items without account assignment are cleared. To keep this from happening, you can use a prepared enhancement to add a second set of account assignment fields in your business partner items. The added account assignment fields then receive the additional designation Assigned Subsequently to Account (for example Profit Center (Assigned Subsequently to Account)). If the original account assignments are not set, after implementing the enhancement, fill the additional fields with the appropriate account assignments using a mass activity (on the SAP Easy Access screen under Changeovers in Live System&nbsp;&nbsp;Set Subsequent Account Assignments in Business Partner Items; transaction FP_KMIG). The system derives the appropriate account assignment using event 0949. You have to define this event to meet your requirements. You can use these subsequently set account assignments as follows: Follow-on postings for items with subsequent account assignment receive the account assignments in exactly the same way as if the original fields in the business partner item had had these account assignments. The system takes follow-on postings into account for:Clearing (cash discounts, payment surcharges, exchange rate differences, down payments on request, charges on request) Write-off (expense or revenue) Interest Calculation The goal is for all postings to have account assignment to the income statement, and not to allow any new, open business partner items to be created without account assignment. Therefore, the system always takes into account all subsequently set account assignments, without taking a key-date-dependent view, as with reports on open items. The clearing posting on the receivables account or payables account is not affected by the subsequent account assignments, since the clearing of an item always has to be posted with the same account assignments as were used when the item was created. Valuation gains and valuation losses resulting from foreign currency valuation also receive their account assignments as if the account assignments were already entered in the original fields in the business partner items. You can also take the subsequent account assignments into account for key date evaluations of open items (reclassification, aging, foreign currency valuation). For each company code, enter the key date, starting from which this should take place, in Customizing for Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable under Closing Operations&nbsp;&nbsp;Define Settings for Subsequent Account Assignments. The system then displays the balances and all required adjustment postings for receivables and payables as if the original account assignment fields were set. Since the general ledger still records the balances without account assignment, the system proposes additional adjustment postings, that you can post from the SAP Easy Access screen under Periodic Processing&nbsp;&nbsp;Closing Preparation&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjustments for Subsequent Account Assignment (transaction FPACCADJ). Using these adjustments, the system reduces the balances without account assignment using the adjustment accounts for receivables and payables, and builds up balances with account assignment. As a result of this adjustment, the receivables and payables for postings from subsequent account assignments appear in the balance sheet as if they were originally entered with these account assignments. Note The entries in the Customizing activity Define Settings for Subsequent Account Assignments then also cause the enrichment of account assignments for key date evaluations, if no subsequent account assignments were set, but an enrichment was made at event 0945 during the general ledger transfer. All adjustment postings for receivables and payables then inherit the account assignments that the system added during the general ledger transfer. For more information, see the documentation for event 0945. unknown Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable Set Subsequent Account Assignments",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,,Other,Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable,,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,,Other,0.029427164192522937,0.21824000348081488,-0.028210034249612964,-0.021531958058617812,-0.04406767100080471,-0.08991800653432257,-0.07585395320079287,0.06876952247992645,-0.04212737391873896,-0.022746853447968163,-0.001495863641603426,-0.05623101597556907,0.1343219545852573,0.044063331349332345,0.09329615321857385,0.0033467060782642853,-0.024830144047827393,-0.1556500040469896,-0.06005782734322914,0.019289342404817673,0.0019799978471331144,0.015761064706416132,-0.10431901096228618,-0.0016985124641091648,0.043349365053123486,-0.016845739242468308,-0.029121673734787742,0.002148313229730949,-0.04839194188603475,-0.014444083451364702,-0.06456429553553644,-0.02314129128513276,-0.03786630012551578,0.06399898004598566,0.18214870574527586,0.03339510980518766,-0.008197931669616321,-0.08486100401758635,-0.003555091278276535,-0.1414037491082086,0.01776657615382137,0.1566550280064576,0.04234836117767637,-0.011055171073981985,0.059561266137107695,0.0705011422236935,-0.0373414114473995,0.16195619613992496,0.011526437965168867,-0.006233838362082853

"Cost Components - Materials Main Cost Component Splits and Auxiliary Cost Component Splits You can display the costs as a cost component split for the cost of goods manufactured and/or primary cost component split. You can calculate the cost component split for the cost of goods manufactured and primary cost component split simultaneously. You can switch between the two cost component views (under Settings&nbsp;&nbsp;Type of cost component split). However, you can also generate only the cost component split for the cost of goods manufactured or the primary cost component split. If you want to cost both cost component splits simultaneously, you must determine which cost component split is the main cost component split in Customizing for Product Cost Controlling. You can also generate a further cost component split as an auxiliary cost component split for comparison purposes. Note The update of the standard price in the material master is effected by the main cost component split.An itemization is only created for the main cost component split. In the report, you can switch between the main cost component split and the auxiliary cost component split. With the appropriate setting, you can switch between the cost component split for the cost of goods manufactured and the primary cost component split. Upper Level/Lower Level/Aggregate Level The cost estimate enables you to analyze the value added within a multilevel production structure. You can apportion the costs for each material according to the lower level and upper level. You can find the cost component split display under Costs&nbsp;&nbsp;Display Cost components. You can make this setting with Settings&nbsp;&nbsp;Layout. You can create your own report from a large number of selections options. When you display the costs: For the upper level, you see the production costs, overhead costs and costs for external activities that are expected for this production level. For the lower level, you see the costs of all material components that are processed in this production level. In both cases, the costs are broken down according to cost components. The total cost of the upper level and lower level equals the total costs of the production level being analyzed. You can go to the following other reports in the same report group: Total values Upper level Lower level When the costs are apportioned according to cost components, the original identity of the costs (for example, costs of materials or fixed and variable production costs) are maintained throughout all production levels. At every production level, the value added at that level and the costs of the lower level can be separated through the cost component split. When you save a material cost estimate or a costing run, the system automatically updates a cost component split for each costed material. If you want to create a cost component split for raw materials and purchased parts, you can enter additive cost components for each material for these costs. You can then group these cost components in an ""External procurement"" cost component structure that only contains such costs. This report shows the costs calculated in a material cost estimate or sales order cost estimate across all production levels, broken down into cost components. You can analyze the costs of the cost component split for the cost of goods manufactured and the costs of the primary cost component split. The results of a cost estimate are updated as cost components (this is called a cost component split). The cost components break down the costs of a material across the entire production structure into material costs, production costs, material overhead, production overhead, and other costs. The costs for internal activities normally flow into the cost component split under secondary cost elements. In order to present primary costs for internal activities, you can use a primary cost component split as an alternative way of outlining the cost components. The cost component split enables you to do the following: Analyze the cost origin across multiple production levels.You can analyze the value added within a multilevel production structure. The costs of the upper level consist of the internal activities and the overhead costs that are incurred at that level. The costs of the lower level include the materials and raw materials. The total costs of the upper level and lower level equal the total costs of the production level being analyzed. View the costs by original production factors (primary cost component split). Structure the costs according to the requirements of other areas (such as material valuation or profitability analysis).In the cost component view, you can specify which cost elements are displayed in the report. For example, you can select the cost of goods manufactured or the cost of goods sold, or the costs that are relevant to inventory valuation. You specify various cost component views in Customizing for Product Cost Planning. For each cost component, you can decide which share of the costs contained therein (fixed, variable, full) is displayed in which cost component view.

"Reverse Overdue Deferrals You can either reverse deferral requests individually or use mass processing if you want to reverse more than one deferral request at a time. The program does not process deferral documents that have been cleared before the reversal. When reversing a posted deferral request, newly parked documents are generated for the deferral requests not yet paid or only partially paid. This involves open items that refer to the same original receivable being grouped together as one item. You define the net due date for the new documents in screen section Specify Due Date for Follow-On Posting. The newly generated documents inherit the request type Deferral Request and can be processed further as a deferral request. With the approval procedure, offsetting items are only generated when the parked reversal documents of the original deferral request are posted. Deferral interest calculated with a deferral request is written off with the reversal and, in the case of partial payments, is recalculated. It is displayed in the new request as a new item. The original deferral interest is canceled when the reversal is posted with an offsetting item. A reversed deferral request is flagged with the value 1 (deferral reversed) in the document header in the field Reason for Reversal, whilst new requests are flagged with value 6 (new document from deferral reversal) in the field Reason for Reversal. Mass Deferral For mass deferrals, you receive a list of deferral requests in accordance with the selection criteria entered. You select the deferrals you want to reverse from the list. If the customer does not pay the deferred receivable, not even by the new due date, you can reverse (cancel, undo) the deferral request. unknown Funds Management-Specific Postings Reverse Overdue Deferrals",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,Other,Other,Other,,Other,Other,SAP Fiori theme for SAP GUI for HTML (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA),SAP Fiori visual theme for classic applications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA,unknown,,,Other,0.012586869193260172,0.09285622230843626,0.012546954568830457,-0.04346352249764462,-0.03187759480429305,-0.04531920827256897,0.05446609994760551,0.03245847927437412,-0.03792029322292545,-0.0199165157630191,0.006045859582270637,-0.013760009881572017,0.016273689262599922,0.04658176354865723,0.029061518561499442,-0.0013479912577444642,0.010112673302689633,-0.00022548084855092317,0.0013654087269806764,0.019378350768535516,0.029811477012750505,0.030267137105376065,0.02201447943366369,0.010083713461057648,-0.015924230174278534,0.014257802501764876,-0.012693333124036752,0.012408563662881638,-0.050285812811507305,0.0055485005629967495,-0.03410765283654791,-0.016393694794831236,-0.018154988907255223,0.016601873243028597,0.04846886632552979,0.03700263095059683,-0.05014372278080169,-0.07752892703145076,0.03511430198833576,0.06141113941855244,0.004157203170457937,0.010077466505784213,-0.16642520225214585,0.05040431222405477,0.006429174672134894,-0.16393255732621495,0.030469209574606245,-0.08660898637910971,-0.034875532483218494,-0.06775478437318343
"Reversal Run for Dunning Notices The system resets either the whole run or the items that were not successfully posted and marks the relevant entries in the dunning history as being reversed. The system determines and reverses the charges and interest posted during the dunning activity run and resets the creditworthiness for the customer in question. To reset additional dunning activities, you have to define a function module for event 0395 for each activity. The reversed entries in the dunning history are not included in the dunning level determination for the next dunning proposal run. Note Note for the Industry Component Utilities IndustryThe lock document created by the dunning notice is deactivated. If a dunning activity run has not been performed correctly (for example, incorrect issue date), or if individual items of the dunning activity run have not been successfully posted, because, for example, individual business partners were locked by a parallel process, you can use the Mass Reversal of Dunning Notices function (transaction FPVC) to reverse a complete dunning proposal run or the dunning notices not run successfully, and to reset all entries with errors in the dunning activity run.

"Create Ref. Measuring Points for Obj The assignment of reference measuring points to reference functional locations ensures that creating functional locations is quick, easy, and error-free. Using reference functional locations with reference measuring points offers you the following benefits: There is less work involved in creating functional locations. There is less chance of errors being entered manually, thus improving the quality of the data. It is easier to make changes centrally. You can map your structures as follows: You can map object-typical structures in the form of reference functional locations, which are later used as templates for creating functional locations . Map really distinctive structures in the form of functional location structures. You can also incorporate equipment and equipment hierarchies into functional locations. Legal requirements may make it necessary to log values for individual components within the technical objects. To meet these requirements, you need to use measuring points and counters at the equipment and functional location structures. As a rule, you use reference functional locations as a basis for creating functional location structures. If reference measuring points are assigned to the reference functional locations , certain data from the reference measuring points is copied into the measuring points of the functional locations and the measuring points are created automatically. unknown Measuring points and counters Create Ref.

In the chart view, the system displays the amounts related to the week, month, or quarter of due date in the selected display currency. You can combine multiple dimensions to adapt the display. Example By choosing View by, you can group the overdue items by main transaction and net due date. Under Settings, on the chart tab, you can adapt the dimensions displayed. You can select one or more business partners and create a worklist. While processing the worklist items, you can trigger follow-up activities. Note In order for the system to generate worklists in the backend system, the FICA_EHP7_B1 Business Function must be active in the client of the backend system in which you would like to process the worklists. In the backend system, you process and monitor the worklists in the FPCKWL transaction. With the Analyze Overdue Items and (F0860, deprecated) and Analyze Overdue Items (F0860A) apps, you display how many items are overdue or what the total amount is that overdue items add up to. You can total or filter the amount and number of overdue items by various criteria.

"Create Rate Routing You can link routings and the material to be produced in the following ways (see graphic): A routing can be used to produce several materials (for example red and green chairs). Material and routing can belong to different plants, for example the planning plant and the production plant must not be the same. A material can be produced with different routings. The different routings can be from different plants. You use this function to determine which material is to be produced with a routing or rate routing.

"Manage Substances, Manage Substances - Specification Database With this SAP component you create specifications for objects such as substances, dangerous goods classifications, and packagings and assign characteristics to these objects using identifiers . For each specification you enter structured data and text information, for example, in the form of phrases . You can find information about R and S phrases, material safety data sheet requirements, or physical attributes. The SAP system offers you a selection of typical properties, known as value assignment types , in a property tree . If required, you can use Customizing for Basic Data and Tools to define your own property trees and value assignment types. Specification management uses interfaces to external systems to enable you to determine secondary values from existing values. You can then transfer this secondary data and use it to assign values to specifications (see Secondary Data Determination ). Data security must be guaranteed for data you store in specification management . The SAP authorization concept prevents unauthorized access to specification data. All changes to data are logged and thus traceable. The SAP system enables the creation of a central specification database. The database can be used for cross-company queries, that is for research purposes or to provide immediate information for incident management. The large amount of information is stored in one central location. The database can also store data for information purposes on specifications of substances that are not physically handled in a company. Data can be recorded in local specification databases and then be matched up with the data stored in a central specification database. Data from the central specification database is then distributed to other systems within companies, which process data for planning, checks, and evaluations.

"Send References - F&R Integration You can create a new reference module manually or automatically and assign it to a new article. You can create one assignment per article and site. The reference module can consist of any number of reference articles, which you can weight individually. You can change existing reference modules and assign them manually or automatically. When you assign references automatically, the system looks for suitable reference articles using several criteria, including the following: Merchandise category Article hierarchy Article attributes You can assign weighted articles to a reference determination schema stored in the article master. Before assigning, the system carries out a listing check and evaluates the listing periods . During automatic processing, you also have to take into consideration that: Changes to the merchandise category and the article hierarchy do not automatically lead to new reference assignments. You can use general settings in Customizing to stop the system overwriting existing references. If the Customizing setting for the structured article is changed after you have created the reference assignment, the reference assignment is not automatically adjusted. During manual processing, you can use the following functions: You can transfer reference module assignments for new articles to other plants. For more information, see Outbound Interface for Reference Modules . Where-used list for a reference module The where-used list contains all combinations of article and site to which the reference module is assigned. You assign the single reference or the reference module in the master data for the article. If you change a reference module or the assignment of a reference module to a new article, SAP S/4HANA creates change pointers which enable you to transfer the assignment or the reference module to SAP F&amp;R anew. This function enables you to prepare requirements planning for new articles for which there is no historical sales data yet. You can use it in SAP S/4HANA to assign one or more reference articles manually or automatically to an article-site combination (reference assignment). The system groups these assignments in a reference module. Once this data has been transferred to SAP F&amp;R, you in your role as replenishment planner can plan a new article there with the historical data of one or several reference article(s). The reference modules created in SAP S/4HANA and their assignments to articles are only used operatively in SAP F&amp;R.

"Manage Reconciliation Key You can use the app to manually create, display, close and delete a reconciliation keys. You can use the reconciliation keys you create for any postings as long as the keys remain open. You can aggregate reconciliation keys under one reconciliation key (aggregation key) before the transfer to the general ledger. In that case, the system adds the totals records that have the same account assignment together, which reduces the number of totals records. As a result, you transfer only the totals records of the aggregation key. This enables you to reduce the number of posting items in the general ledger. When you create a reconciliation key you can flag the reconciliation key for aggregation. If you set the indicator, the reconciliation key can only be transferred to the general ledger after it has been aggregated. When you select a reconciliation key for display from the list, you receive a general overview of the use of the reconciliation key. In addition, the app displays the following: The status of the transfer of the reconciliation key The transfer documents posted in the general ledger from the posting totals of the reconciliation key The totals records contained in the reconciliation key Before you can transfer the totals records posted with a reconciliation key to the general ledger, you must close a reconciliation key. This ensures that no other postings are carried out for a reconciliation key and that the recorded values cannot be changed. Some processes close reconciliation keys automatically (for example, all mass activities, such as the payment and dunning runs). If the system does not close the reconciliation key automatically, close it manually by using the app. If you have created a reconciliation key but have not grouped any postings under the reconciliation key, you can delete the reconciliation key by using the app. In addition you can use the app to do the following: Transfer totals records to the general ledger You can transfer a reconciliation key only if its status is closed and the key contains postings. Reverse the transfer to the general ledger You can only perform a reversal if the transfer status of the key is transferred. Display totals records Check totals records The system checks totals records only if the reconciliation key contains totals records. Note From the Manage Reconciliation Keys app, you can access the following transactions: Create Reconciliation Key (transaction FPF1) Change Reconciliation Key (transaction FPF2) Display Reconciliation Key (transaction FPF3) Display Documents for Reconciliation Key (transaction FPT5) Display Posting Totals (transaction FPT7) Aggregate Reconciliation Key (transaction FPFAGG) Transfer Total Records to G/L (transaction FPG1) Reverse (transaction FPG8) With this app, you can manage reconciliation keys.

"Create Warehouse Tasks - Posting Change When EWM creates a warehouse task for a warehouse request, it uses putaway strategies to determine the storage bin, or stock removal strategies to determine the stock. For more information, see Storage Bin Determination for Putaway or Stock Determination. Extract Time Determination The extract time determination calculates the target time effort to execute a stock movement. EWM determines this time for each warehouse task. Warehouse order creation adds up the extract time of the individual warehouse tasks for a warehouse order. Optionally, warehouse order creation supplements the extract time determination with a setup time that is defined in the warehouse order creation rule. In addition, if resource management is used, a route time is determined based on the resource used. The warehouse order includes the sum of these times. Based on this, EWM determines the latest start time of a warehouse order. The parameters of extract time determination formulas for a warehouse task are dependent on the product, the quantity, the unit to be transported, and geographical dependencies. For more information about Customizing for extract time determination, see Customizing for Extended Warehouse Management under Cross-Process Settings&nbsp;&nbsp;Warehouse Task&nbsp;&nbsp;Define Extract Time Determination. Determination of Packing Instructions / Packaging Specifications for Customer-Defined Packing and Picking When creating warehouse tasks for relevant outbound delivery order items, the system determines suitable packing instructions or packaging specifications using unified package building (see Unified Package Building). Outbound delivery order items are relevant if the predecessor sales document item is relevant to pick HUs by packing instruction or packaging specification. The system takes the packing instruction or packaging specification into account during the filtering and sorting of stock (see Storage Bin Determination for Stock Removal). As a prerequisite, the document type of the outbound delivery process for the outbound delivery order must contain a unified package building profile for picking HUs by packing instruction or packaging specification. For more information, see Customizing for Extended Warehouse Management under Goods Issue Process&nbsp;&nbsp;Outbound Delivery&nbsp;&nbsp;Define Document Types for Outbound Delivery Process. For more information about customer-defined packing and picking, see Customer-Defined Packing and Picking. Extended Warehouse Management (EWM) uses this function so that when you or EWM release a wave, EWM simultaneously creates warehouse tasks for stock removal or internal stock movements. EWM creates warehouse orders pursuant to the warehouse tasks, to assemble work packages for the individual warehouse workers. Instead of this standard creation of warehouse tasks through wave release, you can also create a warehouse task as follows: Manually, with the user interface Automatically, by calling a Post Processing Framework action (PPF action) Warehouse Clerk (Extended Warehouse Management) : Plans and controls processes in a simple warehouse with a strong focus on inbound, outbound, physical inventory, and maintenance of warehouse specific master data.

"Periodic Allocation Results Preparation: Transformation of cycles to graphsThe system transforms the allocation or simulation of a cycle into a recursive hierarchy whose nodes form the senders and receivers.Create a graph.Select whether the cycle was used for a posting or a simulation. Use the input help for the field Controlling Area to select the cycle and other parameters. Enter version 000. In the case of very large cycles, the transformation may take some time; this is indicated by the status Triggered. If necessary, you can cancel transformations with this status.You can restart failed transforms. If the transformation is not successful even after several restarts, delete the graph and create it again. List of graphs or transformations with statusYou can start the app Visualized Period-Based Allocation Result from the list, by clicking on a row directly.For completed graphs, in a dialog box you select how many hierarchy levels and which fields are to be displayed. Choose Calculateto determine the number of senders and receivers. This allows you to estimate whether your selection is suitable for your analysis purposes.Recommendation If you have a very large number of senders and receivers, it is recommended that you reduce the number of fields or hierarchy levels to be displayed for performance and traceability reasons.For more information about this, see Visualized Period-Based Allocation Result in the section “Features”.For graphs with other statuses, you can view the change log.To keep the list clear, you can apply filters in the upper screen area, or delete graphs that are no longer required (exception: graphs with status Triggered or Pending Transfer). You can use this app to display how the total costs of a selected cycle are allocated from each individual sender to the receivers in a network graph. The graph can display each allocated cost amount such that you can analyze exactly from which senders (for example, cost centers) costs in which amounts are allocated to the receivers (for example, different orders).

"Create Inventory Sampling Procedure - ERP System This component reduces the time and cost of a physical inventory considerably by counting only the stock of individual materials and carrying out an extrapolation to arrive at an estimated count result for all units of stock managed in the system (stock management units). The more materials a company has, the more costly it is to carry out a physical inventory by counting all stocks. The principle of extrapolation during sample taking is also used in quality inspection in the system: only one particular sample is inspected. The result is then applied to the entire quantity. However, such conclusions (from several counts of all stock management units) are only allowed when certain criteria are fulfilled: The scope of the stock management units involved in the physical inventory must be large enough. The selection of stock management units to be counted must be “representative”. Mathematical/statistical processes are used to perform the inventory sampling: A sample to be counted is randomly selected from the stock management units subject to physical inventory. The size of the sample depends on the probable degree of confidence that is valid for the projection of individual count results on all the stock management units involved. On the basis of the posted count results, the system carries out an extrapolation for all the stock management units included in the physical inventory. The inventory sampling is considered successful, if there is only a small deviation between the extrapolated value and the book value and a high probability that the extrapolation result contains only a minor error. In the case of a successful inventory sampling, it is assumed that the estimated variances from the book inventory are so small that they can be safely ignored. As in the case of a “standard” physical inventory, only the stock of the elements actually counted is adjusted. The stock of the remaining stock management units remains unchanged. If an inventory sampling is not successful, a complete physical inventory must be carried out for the stock management units not counted. unknown Inventory Management ERP System Create Inventory Sampling Procedure - ERP System",0,0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.818,0.91,0.812,Other,,Other,Inventory Management,,Other,"This component reduces the time and cost of a physical inventory considerably by counting only the stock of individual materials and carrying out an extrapolation to arrive at an estimated count result for all units of stock managed in the system (stock management units).
